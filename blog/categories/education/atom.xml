If you are fortunate enough to work in the technology industry, you do not need permission to move forward. So do it now.</p>

<p>Yes, you will have to define <em>it</em> for yourself.</p>

<h4>ChiPMA – Product Management</h4>

<p>A few years ago I had the pleasure of hearing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igsvMAU5POY">Suneel Gupta</a> speak at a Chicago Product Management Association meeting hosted by Pathfinder Development. Three points raised during Gupta’s talk:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conditions are never perfect. So start now.</li>
<li>What does <em>start</em> mean? Figure that out, and draw out the plan.</li>
<li>If you suck at first, keep going.</li>
<li>Conditions are never perfect.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Learning From History</h4>

<p>Gupta is a student of history. He began the talk by drawing parallels between today’s startup culture and the early days of powered flight.</p>

<p>In the late 1800s, Samuel Pierpont Langley was an accomplished engineer with great connections to money and resources. One of his lifelong goals was to develop a vehicle for powered flight. He built several successful models, hired the smartest collaborators he could find, and he even raised $50k (in 1898 dollars) from investors. Newspaper reporters followed his entourage as they conducted experiments. Surely, this team of thoroughbreds would solve the flight puzzle.</p>

<p>But most people have never heard of Langley. Somewhere in Ohio, far from the news outlets of the day, the Wright Brothers achieved the goal first. When Langley heard the news, he stopped trying.</p>

<p>Why did the Wright Brothers win? They never waited for perfect conditions. The Wright Brothers did what they could with the resources they had at the time. Maybe constraints are advantages in disguise.</p>

<h4>Draw Out the Plan</h4>

<p>Everybody has dreams. Something magical happens when we take the time to map out our dreams on paper.</p>

<p>Gupta’s example: Jack Dorsey, creator of Twitter. Dorsey drew the first mock-up for Twitter on paper. And then he showed it to people. Some laughed. Many gave feedback. He used the feedback to hone the idea into a viable product.</p>

<p>Until you put the idea on paper (or some other medium) so you can show it to potential customers and collaborators, you’ll never get the feedback you need to improve.</p>

<h4>Keep Going</h4>

<p>Gupta and his brother had an idea. They wanted to create videos about the first wave of Indians to move to America. They approached Hollywood experts about creating the videos.</p>

<p>"You’ll need at least $1 million," they were told. Much too expensive. Most people fold when facing a million dollar wall.</p>

<p>But Suneel and his brother made their own videos with the equipment they had available. The videos were not million-dollar productions. But here’s the upside: When they were done, they had something of substance that they could show to people. They posted their work at <a href="http://kahanimovement.com">KahaniMovement.com</a>. One viewer liked the site enough to send a link to Steven Spielberg.</p>

<p>Spielberg viewed the videos and he gave the brothers clear, actionable feedback. They made improvements. And they learned something interesting about Spielberg in the process: Even Spielberg starts with a loose cut sometimes! When Spielberg has a fresh idea that he’s trying to communicate, he will grab a hand-held camera, shoot the idea (no matter how rough) and show it to his team. If a picture is a thousand words, then a video is… you get the idea.</p>

<h4>Teachers &amp; Parents Ignite Our Passion</h4>

<p>Gupta shared a story about his 7th grade social studies class. The class watched a film of JFK delivering his inaugural speech in 1960. Gupta was moved. At the end of the film, the teacher informed that class that JFK had not written the speech. The author was Ted Sorensen, a man whom Kennedy called his <em>intellectual blood bank</em>.</p>

<p>In 7th grade, Gupta had found his calling. He would become a speech writer.</p>

<p>He went home and told his mother about his decision to become a speech writer. And that’s when his mother gave him a powerful piece of advice: "If you want to do that, you don’t have to wait. You can do it now."</p>

<p>You can do it now. What are you waiting for?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/objective-c-big-nerd.png" align="right" width="250" height="357" alt="Objective-C Programming - The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" title="Objective-C Programming - The Big Nerd Ranch Guide"></p>

<blockquote><p>You will be baffled from time to time… Stick with this book. I promise the bewilderment will cease before you get to the final page.<br/>~ Aaron Hillegass, Author</p></blockquote>

<h4>Finding the Right Objective-C Book</h4>

<p>I've gone through several Objective-C books in my quest to master <a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>. You read that right: I'm learning Objective-C so that I can master RubyMotion. <em>Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em> is one book that clicks for me. Here's why.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li><p>Minimal fluff. Other Objective-C books start off with speeches about why a dev should write for iOS. What a waste of paper. The Big Nerd approach: Start with a few paragraphs about C, and then jump right in to Xcode installation followed by "Hello World." Refreshingly direct.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear examples. As I immerse myself deeper into the world of Objective-C, I am troubled by much of the documentation. It's okay to describe a method signature, but a description with an example is much better. While reading other Objective-C books, I found myself pausing to search Stack Overflow for alternate explanations. The Big Nerd book is better because everything is self-contained. Method descriptions are followed by clear examples.</p></li>
<li><p>Zero Assumptions. Even though the book contains minimal fluff, readers will appreciate how the author defines terms throughout the text. For example, the book does not assume that the reader knows the classroom definition of the word <em>syntax</em>. It defines the word explicitly:</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Syntax is the set of rules that governs how your code must be written in a given programming language. These rules are extremely specific, and if you fail to follow them, your program won't work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Clearly put!</p>

<h4>Do I Really Need Objective-C?</h4>

<p>Yes. If you want to be effective with RubyMotion, you must grow strong with Objective-C.</p>

<p>The RubyMotion devs whom I admire most also know Objective-C. Devs like Matt Aimonetti (creator of BubbleWrap), Randall Thomas and Tammer Saleh (authors of <em>RubyMotion in the Cloud</em>), Jonathan Penn (instructor/speaker at CocoaConf) and Laurent Sansonetti (creator of RubyMotion) move seamlessly between the worlds of Ruby and Objective-C. Luke became a Jedi because he followed in the footsteps of Yoda.</p>

<p>More important than following the masters: Learning from their triumphs and mistakes by reading their code. Developers in 2013 are fortunate to have tools like GitHub where code is shared on a massive scale. Most iOS code is written in Objective-C. If we want to learn from the iOS code that has been written before, we need to know Objective-C.</p>

<h4>Highly Recommended</h4>

<p>If you want to develop apps for iOS devices, start with <em>Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em>. The book is also helpful if you prefer RubyMotion over Objective-C.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/02/26/atari-pong-rubymotion-objective-c/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-26T10:35:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/02/26/atari-pong-rubymotion-objective-c</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/pong-rubymotion-objective-c.png" width="300" height="160" alt="Atari's Pong in RubyMotion and Objective-C" title="Atari's Pong in RubyMotion and Objective-C" align="right">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Atari's Pong</a> is a classic video arcade game from the 1970s. Seeing Pong always gives me childhood flashbacks.</p>

<h4>Pong in Objective-C</h4>

<p>I recently completed the <a href="http://mobilemakers.co/ios-accelerated">iOS Accelerated</a> course at the <a href="http://mobilemakers.co/">Mobile Makers Academy</a>. For one of our homework assignments, we were asked to build a version of Pong that runs on iOS. Our instructor, <a href="http://twitter.com/dbora">Don Bora</a>, started us off with some skeleton code in Objective-C. Each student had to take Don's code and:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add paddles.</li>
<li>Make the paddles move on their own.</li>
<li>Make the ball bounce off the moving paddles.</li>
<li>Keep score.</li>
<li>Let one or two players control the paddles via touch.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h4>Questions to Consider</h4>

<p>How do you determine whether the pixels of the ball have collided with the pixels of a paddle? What about wall collisions? When a collision occurs, where should the ball bounce next? As with any application, there are many details to consider.</p>

<h4>Building Blocks</h4>

<p>Of course, Don had already introduced the necessary skills in earlier lectures, labs, and homework. It was our job to put the pieces together.</p>

<p>Members of the class paired with each other. We shared solutions and advice. In time, we each ended up with a working version of Pong in Objective-C. It's exciting to see a favorite childhood game running in the iOS simulator on your own machine, especially if you built the game yourself.</p>

<h4>Pong in RubyMotion</h4>

<p>Since my day job revolves around Ruby, it made sense to re-write the exercise in <a href="http://rayhightower.dev/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>. Here are video clips of my two solutions. The first was written in Objective-C during the Mobile Makers course. The second was written in RubyMotion.</p>

<center><iframe name="pong-oc" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9LETiMdi9jQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe></center>




<center><iframe name="pong-rm" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lt-JKqiA_fg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<p>As expected, the two solutions look similar. Source code is on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-oc">Pong in Objective-C</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-rm">Pong in RubyMotion</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>RubyMotion Gotchas</h4>

<p>I encountered a few RubyMotion snags during development:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Mouseovers Ingored</em>. Normally, when running the simulator with RubyMotion, you can mouse over an object in the simulator, hit the command key, and grab a handle to the object.  This behavior was absent in landcape mode with version 1.31 of RubyMotion. The release notes for version 1.33 mention that the problem has been solved. However, that was not my experience.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Touch Events Ignored on Part of Screen</em>. For some reason, the simulator ignored touch events on the right side of the screen. When I programatically moved the right paddle closer to the left side of the screen, both paddles responded to touch events. Searches of Google and Stack Overflow reveal that others have encounterd the same issue with touch events, especially in landcape mode.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><em>Update (3/13/2013): The issue with touch events has been resolved, thanks to advice from Turki Al-Qusaimi in the comments below. Updated code has been pushed to the <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/pong-rm">master branch on GitHub</a>.</em></p>

<p>Of course, I introduced a few bugs of my own while developing the Pong game. At one point, the velocity of the ball increased every time a player scored. It made the game exciting! But I didn't know the cause of the acceleration, and good developers strive to maintain better control over their projects.</p>

<p>I eventually found the acceleration problem: When using an NSTimer object to control animation, you have to invalidate the timer at the beginning of each cycle, or the animation will accelerate. That's a useful thing to know.</p>

<p>The rest of my work in RubyMotion went well, and I continue to enjoy the product. I plan to update the code once the touch event issues have been resolved.</p>

<h4>Why Play Games?</h4>

<p>Why should a serious developer spend time writing games? I can think of a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Writing a game challenges our skills on many levels. In the case of Pong, we have to dust off our old physics and geometry textbooks to ensure that the ball bounces like a real ball.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing a game lets us break out of our constraints. Devs who write business apps are very familiar with constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>Because writing a game is fun.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, the most important reason was given by a captain of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701:</p>

<blockquote><p>The more advanced the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.
<br/>~James T. Kirk</p></blockquote>

<h4>Room for Improvement</h4>

<p>Building the Pong game was an interesting exercise in testing the capabilities of RubyMotion. Having done the work, I can look back and see some areas where I could improve the results. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Automated testing. These proof-of-concept exercises were done without automated testing. What is the best way to apply test driven development to a game? RubyMotion comes with a TDD framework, MacBacon. That would be a great subject for a future blog post.</p></li>
<li><p>Better design. Each exercise looks like something from the 1970s! How would Pong function if it was created in 2013?</p></li>
<li><p>Better collision detection. I'm using a built-in iOS method to detect ball collisions. The built-in detection works fine with the stationary walls, but not as well with the moving paddles. If I write a future version of Pong, I should also write a custom collision detection method.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Comments and Pull Requests</h4>

<p><a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">My team and I</a> build business apps. My gaming experience is limited. If you are a game developer, and if you see anything in my code that could be done better, your ideas are welcome. Feel free to submit a <a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-rm">pull request via GitHub</a>, or you can drop a note in the comments below. Thanks!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/apprenticeship-patterns.gif" align="right" width="180" height="236" alt="Apprenticeship Patterns" title="Apprenticeship Patterns"></p>

<blockquote><p><em>In times of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.<br/>- Eric Hoffer, Reflections on the Human Condition</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Blogger's Note: This review of the book <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/davehoover">Dave H. Hoover</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ade_oshineye">Adewale Oshineye</a> was originally posted at <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/book-reviews/">ChicagoRuby.org/book-reviews</a>.</p>

<h4>A New Profession</h4>

<p>Software development is among the newest of professions – roughly 70 years old depending on what you consider to be the beginning. The field is in a constant state of flux. New languages, new theories, new ways of communicating with clients… the list seems endless. How does a new developer keep up? How does a seasoned developer avoid growing stale?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>How to Excel</h4>

<p>Apprenticeship Patterns was written as a guide for developers who want to excel throughout their careers. You might think of the book as a compilation of design patterns applied to human beings. Yes, the book is suitable for new developers. But seasoned people will find value as well. One useful pattern for veterans: Share What You Learn. All of us see old ideas through fresh glasses when we’re questioned about them. “When one person teaches, two people learn,” says the book.</p>

<p>How did the authors compile the list of patterns? They reflected on their own practices and they asked other developers. They spoke with software professionals at various stages of their careers to find out what steps they took (and continue to take) to keep growing.</p>

<h4>Non-Linear Reading</h4>

<p>The book can be read in a non-linear fashion if you prefer. I would suggest that you start with the Reading List pattern on page 100, followed by Read Constantly on page 111. These two patterns do a great job of framing the rest of the book because the reader will be executing the pattern while reading about it. There’s something meta about starting that way, and meta is cool.</p>

<p>The Reading List pattern inspired me to post my personal reading list on GitHub.</p>

<h4>Steer Your Own Education</h4>

<p>One theme consistently appears throughout the book: If you want to be a great software developer, you must be an active participant in your own education. Formal education might be a good start, but it’s not enough. Formal programs tell you what to read. Formal programs tell what to do in the classroom, and if you’re a good student you do it. But here’s something that we rarely do: While finishing a formal assignment, how many of us stop to consider whether we’ve been assigned the best curriculum for our long term goals?</p>

<p>The professional person must be a continuous student. Patterns give us a good place to start.</p>

<h4>Improvements</h4>

<p>What should the next edition of Apprenticeship Patterns look like? For starters, I would love to read an electronic version… filled with hyperlinks. All of the apprenticeship patterns relate to other patterns, and being able to click to the related patterns would enrich the learning experience. This book would make a great mobile app, especially if you turn all of the references into hyperlinks. What an exciting learning experience it would be!</p>

<p>Now… if only we could find a hand-held reading device that supports hyperlinks, and a couple of software craftsmen to get the job done :-)</p>

<h4>Update After the Original Post</h4>

<p>Ade Oshineye tweeted with good news a few minutes after the original post:</p>

<blockquote><p>@ChicagoRuby: Wish granted: <a href="http://apprenticeship-patterns.labs.oreilly.com/">http://apprenticeship-patterns.labs.oreilly.com/</a>. The book is available online as a hypertext.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thank you authors!</p>
