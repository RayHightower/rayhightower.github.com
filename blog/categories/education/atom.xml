alt="Feed Wrangler to Replace Google Reader" title="Feed Wrangler to Replace Google Reader">
The decision to cancel Google Reader was disappointing. I consume most news via RSS, and the ability to sync multiple RSS clients between iPhone, iPad, and desktop with Google Reader in the background saved time while keeping me informed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, strong alternatives are emerging. <a href="http://feedwrangler.net">Feed Wrangler</a> is a Google Reader replacement by independent developer <a href="http://david-smith.org">David Smith</a>. Here are my first impressions.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Pros</h4>

<p>After using the service for a few hours, I can already see some things that I like. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimal fluff. Other RSS clients feature big photos and special page-flipping effects. That's not for me. Just the facts, RSS.</li>
<li>Easy RSS import from Google Reader. Just log in with your Google account and follow the prompts. After you import your feeds into Feed Wrangler's web app, you will never need Google Reader again.</li>
<li>Reasonable cost. The Feed Wrangler service costs $19/year. Google dropped Reader because they couldn't make money from the free product. You can't fix that with volume! When an app makes money (directly or indirectly) then the app is more likely to stick around.</li>
<li>Mobile companions. Feed Wrangler's native apps for iPhone and iPad are very important because I consume most RSS on-the-go.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>Like most users, I want the developer to add "just one or two more features" to make the app perfect for me. Of course that's the slippery slope to bloatware since every user has a different set of one-or-two features.</p>

<p>The developer can avoid bloatware by ignoring all other users and focusing on my feature requests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Evernote integration. My current RSS client lets me drop an article into Evernote with a few taps on the screen.</li>
<li>Organized imports. While Feed Wrangler imports feeds from Google Reader, it does not maintain Reader's organization. So I had to organize my feeds manually with Feed Wrangler's "Smart Stream" feature. If Reader's folders could be imported as Feed Wrangler's Smart Streams, that would be cool.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>I plan to try other RSS readers before Google Reader shuts down on July 1st. Feed Wrangler is making a good impression so far.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/31/kali-linux-pentesting/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-31T00:15:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/31/kali-linux-pentesting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/kali-linux-desktop.png" width="400" height="303" title="Kali Linux - The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear." alt="Kali Linux - The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear." align="right">
<a href="http://getbraintree.com">Braintree</a> hosted a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/braintreepayments/events/119511632/">Hax 'n Snax</a> event this afternoon. Devs from around Chicago gathered together to hack on code, socialize, trade ideas, and hone skills. Thanks Braintree for putting on a great event.</p>

<p>My Hax 'n Snax time was spent interacting with other devs and experimenting with a Linux distro that I just discovered, Kali Linux.</p>

<h4>What is Kali Linux?</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.kali.org/">Kali</a> is a fairly new Linux distro designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. If you're looking for a general purpose Linux distro, <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> would be a better choice. Kali is the successor of BackTrack. The developers of Kali and BackTrack, <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Software</a>, state that "Kali is a more mature, secure, and enterprise-ready version of BackTrack Linux." You can download it at <a href="http://kali.org">Kali.org</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Parallels Installation Gotcha</h4>

<p>I'm running Kali Linux inside of Parallels version 7 on Mac OS X 10.8.3 (Mountain Lion). The Linux installation proceeded normally, but when I rebooted the virtual machine, Linux wouldn't come up. Instead, I got the perpetual display of timeouts shown below.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/time-out.png" width="754" height="645" title="Kali Linux time out" alt="Kali Linux time out" align="center"></center>


<p>Google led me to a solution on a blog called <a href="http://redrise.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/installing-kali-in-parallels-desktop-7/">redrise</a>. The solution: To make Kali run on Parallels, uncheck the check box labeled "Show battery in Linux", as shown below.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/show-battery-in-linux.png" width="798" height="653" title="Kali - Show battery in Linux" alt="Kali - Show battery in Linux" align="center"></center>


<p>I'm not sure why a battery indicator would prevent Kali from booting in Parallels, but the solution worked. When I installed Kali on VMWare, the OS ran without special configuration changes.</p>

<h4>The Kali Linux Tools</h4>

<p>Kali comes with over 300 penetration tools. It's open source, so if you see room for improvement, <a href="http://git.kali.org/gitweb/">fork the repo</a> and go to work. If your ideas are strong enough, the developers might accept your pull request. There's even a version of Kali for <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>. Take a look at the GUI.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/kali-linux-security-tools.png" width="798" height="653" title="Kali Linux Security Tools" alt="Kali Linux Security Tools" align="center"></center>


<h4>Using Wireshark on Kali Linux</h4>

<p>Kali includes sniffer tools that can capture WiFi traffic. If the WiFi traffic is "protected" (note the quotes) with an older method like wireless encryption protocol (WEP), Kali's tools can crack the encryption.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/wireshark-kali-linux.png" width="600" height="492" title="Kali Linux Wireshark" alt="Kali Linux Wireshark" align="center"></center>


<p>A screenshot from Wireshark appears above. Wireshark sits and observes network traffic. If a packet looks interesting, drill down to discover the packet's source, destination, and contents.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Kali enables developers and network professionals to protect themselves and their clients from attacks. Kali is powerful, and with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-22T22:13:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack.jpg" width="372" height="600" title="BeagleBone Black" alt="BeagleBone Black" align="right">
<a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">BeagleBone Black</a>, like the <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, is a small, inexpensive computer that runs Linux. It's smaller than a deck of cards and you can buy one for about forty-five dollars ($45.00). The device is made by <a href="http://circuitco.com">CircuitCo</a> in Richardson, TX, USA.</p>

<h3>It Just Works</h3>

<p>BeagleBone Black runs Linux right out of the box. Steps required:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plug in the micro-HDMI cable for the monitor. See the "Gotchas"
section about micro-HDMI below.</li>
<li>Plug in the keyboard &amp; mouse via the USB port. You might need a USB hub because the board only has one USB port.</li>
<li>Add power via the mini-USB port or the 5v power connection.</li>
</ul>


<p>After a few minutes of boot time, we have a fully-functioning Linux computer with a GUI, Firefox browser, and other tools.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The BeagleBone Black has 2GB of flash storage on the board, and part
of that is used for Linux. Here's a screenshot after just a few minutes of ownership.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack-USB.png" width="250" height="200" title="BeagleBone Black USB" alt="BeagleBone Black USB" align="right">
All of the paper documentation for the BeagleBone Black fits on a slip of paper roughly the size of two business cards. The meat of the documentation resides on the device itself. To reach the electronic documentation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Plug the BeagleBone Black into a USB port on your laptop.</li>
<li>The board will appear as a USB storage device. One of the files at the
root of the storage device, <code>START.htm</code>, contains the documentation. It
can be viewed in a web browser.</li>
</ol>


<p>The documentation recommends against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">MSIE</a>.</p>

<h3>Gotchas</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/micro-HDMI-home-depot.jpg" width="400" height="300" title="Micro HDMI Home Depot" alt="Micro HDMI Home Depot" align="right">
The manufacturer included a mini-USB cable with the device, so you can power it up right after you rip open the package. Gotcha: You need a micro-HDMI cable (or adapter) if you want to attach a monitor. I would have preferred a micro-HDMI-to-HDMI adapater in the box instead of the mini-USB cable. That's a little nit-picky on my part since micro-HDMI cables are easy to find at Home Depot.</p>

<p>A quick shout-out to Home Depot: Their store-brand cables let you test the cable end without opening the package, right in the store. Excellent package design by Home Depot.</p>

<p>My second "gotcha" is more important: The <code>curl</code> command did not behave as flawlessly as it did with the Raspberry Pi, so I was not able to install Ruby as quickly as planned. Details below.</p>

<h3>Installing Rails</h3>

<p>I will have to cover Ruby and Rails installation in a future blog post because my initial attempts were not successful. <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">RVM, Ruby, and Rails installed easily with Raspberry Pi</a>, even though the compilation time was long. With the BeagleBone Black, I received the following in response to the <code>curl</code> command:</p>

<p>```bash
sh-4.2# curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current</p>

<pre><code>                             Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
</code></pre>

<p>  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
curl: (77) Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)
sh-4.2#
```</p>

<p>Maybe it's time to try <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBEnv</a>? I'll post a solution when I find it. Or... if a reader of this blog already has a solution for the BeagleBone Black Rails installation challenge, please post in the comments below and I'll credit you here.</p>

<h4>BeagleBone Black vs. Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>Which is better, BeagleBone Black or Raspberry Pi? There's no clear winner in my opinion. It's a matter of trade-offs:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 'Bone runs Linux right out of the box, while it takes some time to get Linux running on the Pi, unless you buy a card pre-configured for the Pi.</li>
<li>RVM, Ruby, and Rails installation was painless on the Pi even though compilation time was long. The jury is still out w/r/t RVM on the 'Bone.</li>
<li>Cost-wise, they're within ten bucks of each other. That's a wash.</li>
<li>The 'Bone has more Ardunio-like provisions for digital projects.</li>
<li>The Pi includes an RCA output for older TVs. Plus the Pi uses standard HDMI, so there's no need to get a special micro-HDMI cable.</li>
</ul>


<p>I've owned my 'Bone for just over 24 hours. Lots more to learn. Looking forward to it!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-16T13:36:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rvm.io">Ruby Version Manager (RVM)</a> is one of my favorite tools in the Ruby ecosystem.  Reason: RVM lets me experiment with Ruby and Rails at will. I don't know about you, but my best experiments are full of risk so they eventually blow things up. When that happens, I can always recover the broken areas without wasting time on a full system restore.</p>

<p>Some devs choose to use another tool, <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBenv</a>, that serves a purpose similar to RVM. I began working with RVM before the other tools existed, and since it has always worked well for me, I have no reason to switch.</p>

<h4>Ruby 2.0.0-p195</h4>

<p>The latest patch of Ruby 2.0.0, p195, was released two days ago. Time to take it for a spin. RVM lets devs upgrade Ruby and manage gemsets seamlessly. Here's how the process went.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Get the Latest RVM</h4>

<p>Instructions for installing RVM are at <a href="http://rvm.io">http://rvm.io</a>.
If you already have RVM installed, you should confirm that you have the
latest version.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm get head
</code></p>

<h4>Grab the Ruby Patch</h4>

<p>With the latest RVM installed, you can upgrade to the latest Ruby
patch level.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm upgrade 2.0.0
Are you sure you wish to upgrade from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195? (Y/n): y
Installing new ruby ruby-2.0.0-p195
Searching for binary rubies, this might take some time.
</code></p>

<p>The process took at least twenty minutes on my system. I don't have an exact time because I began working on other tasks during the upgrade, and when I looked back at the terminal window, the process was mostly complete, except for a few questions about gemsets...</p>

<p><code>bash
Migrating gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195
Are you sure you wish to MOVE gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195?
This will overwrite existing gems in ruby-2.0.0-p195 and remove them from ruby-2.0.0-p0 (Y/n): y
Moving gemsets...
</code>
...and aliases, wrappers, and archiving my patchless Ruby 2.0.0.</p>

<p>```bash
Do you wish to move over aliases? (Y/n): y
Do you wish to move over wrappers? (Y/n): y
Do you also wish to completely remove ruby-2.0.0-p0 (inc. archive)? (Y/n): y
Removing ruby-2.0.0-p0........
Successfully migrated ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195
Upgrade complete!</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>Upgrade complete. Now running the latest patch of Ruby 2.0.0-p195</p>

<p>```bash
~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>   macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86_64 ]
 * ruby-1.9.3-p385 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-2.0.0-p195 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1>=> - current</h1>

<h1>=* - current &amp;&amp; default</h1>

<h1>* - default</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>As a final option, I chose to make this latest Ruby patch my default.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>~$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0 --default
Using /Users/rth/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p195</p>

<p>~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>   macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-1.9.3-p385 [ x86_64 ]
=* ruby-2.0.0-p195 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1>=> - current</h1>

<h1>=* - current &amp;&amp; default</h1>

<h1>* - default</h1>

<p>~$
```
And that's it.</p>
