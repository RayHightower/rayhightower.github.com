    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.paradyn.org/CSCADS2013/index.html">Petascale Tools Workshop</a> is for computer scientists who create tools that enable apps to run efficiently on the world's fastest supercomputers. Supercomputer performance is measured in petaflops: 10<sup><sup>15</sup></sup> floating point operations per second. That's blazing speed, thousands of times faster than the fastest MacBook Pro.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://WisdomGroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> was invited to attend the workshop because we have a client client, <a href="http://www.wisdomgroup.com/case-studies/texas-am-university/">Texas A &amp; M University</a>, operating in the high performance computing (HPC) space. As the only non-PhD in the room, I was given a chance to exercise Pat Metheny's <a href="/blog/2013/07/17/pat-metheny-be-the-worst/">be-the-worst</a> philosophy in the extreme. The result: I learned things that will help WisdomGroup to deliver better solutions for our clients, especially the TAMU team.</p>

<h3>One Megawatt = $1,000,000.00</h3>

<p>As with other disciplines of engineering, supercomputer design is all about managing trade-offs. If you increase the clock speed, how will that affect your electrical bill? If you increase the size of the cache, how much more will you spend on hardware?</p>

<p>Every Petascale Workshop presenter highlighted the toughest constraint: The cost of electrical power. High performance computers gulp electricity. The wattage numbers were all very abstract to me until one presenter layed out a direct one-to-one correspondence between electricity and money. <em>One megawatt of power used over the course of a year costs one million dollars.</em></p>

<p>Express a constraint in terms of money, and the abstractions melt away.</p>

<p>The debate between the scientists was vigorous yet respectful. After hearing the 1-to-1 rule of thumb, one audience member remarked, "I know how to genererate a megawatt for only $865,000." He then outlined his solution, a combination of coal, fossil fuels, and natural gas that would achieve the reduction. The more important point: Electricity is expensive.</p>

<h3>Re-Framing the Power Problem</h3>

<p>There is another way to look at the power problem. Consider it from the perspective of performance, not power. Here's how one presenter put it: No matter where we build a supercomputer, we will only have a limited amount of power. Let's look at the maximum available power as a constraint and go from there.</p>

<p>Rubyists are familiar with the saying &#34;<a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch03_Embrace_Constraints.php">constraints are liberating</a>&#34;, popularized by 37signals. Since power limitations are real constraints, our next step is to figure out how to extract the best results allowed within the constraints.</p>

<h3>Top Five</h3>

<p>Supercomputer scientists are as competitive as olympic athletes. As of June 2013, the five fastest machines in the world are:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br/>
Scientists determine Rmax by running the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a> benchmark. <a href="http://top500.org">Top500.org</a> has more information about the fastest
machines.</p>

<h3>Digging Deeper</h3>

<p>Some of the biggest performance gains can be realized through more efficient software. Most supercomputers run some distribution of Linux. Some teams of researchers focus on ways to optimize the Linux kernel for supercomputing.</p>

<p>Optimization is not a one-size-fits all process. The scientists need to consder the type of applications being run, percentage of time spent on I/O, efficiency of algorithms, and so on. Each potential optimization choice is like a node on an ever expanding tree. The choices are endless, and the seasoned expert will know where to focus for the best results.</p>

<p>In the Ruby world, we might use tools like <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> or <a href="http://codeclimate.com">Code Climate</a> to identify hot spots in our code, places where re-factoring can reduce CPU utilization or improve I/O. HPC tools tend to be highly customizable because the users are intimately familar with their own hardware. During a lunch conversation, one team of scientists shared how they suspected a defect in hardware counters used to measure the behavior of a supercomputer under study. The instincts of the scientists proved correct, and the errant counters were replaced.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>When smart people challenge each other to grow, great things happen. The scientists at the Petascale Tools Workshop were clearly helping each other to grow. The next few years in supercomputing will be exciting!</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>I am grateful to the organizers of the Petascale Tools Workshop for hosting the event, and to the TAMU team for extending the invitation. Thank you both!</p>

Pat Metheny encourages musicians to "be the worst" in whatever band they choose to join. Of course, he does not mean to play poorly.</p>

<p>Rather, he encourages us to surround ourselves with the best musicians we can find so that we can learn from them. The concept is explored further in the book <a href="/blog/2013/02/17/apprenticeship-patterns-by-dave-h-hoover-and-adewale-oshineye/">Apprenticeship Patterns</a> by Dave Hoover and Ade Oshineye.</p>

<p>I was reminded to be-the-worst while attending a conference this week, an event where I was surrounded by computer scientists with much more experience than me. I learned a lot his week. I will share details in a future post.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I invite you to join me in a Pat Metheny learning exercise of your choice. Be the worst!</p>

Yes, the name appears misspelled. But <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feeddler-rss-reader-pro/id365710282?mt=8">FeeddlerPro</a> is my choice for RSS on iPhone and iPad. Feeddler has long been my favorite RSS reader. The developer's decision to add support for services beyond Google Reader (Bazqux Reader, FeedHQ, and The OldReader) sealed the decision for me.</p>

<h3>Second Choice</h3>

<p><a href="/blog/2013/06/21/replacing-google-reader-with-feed-wrangler/">Feed Wrangler</a> was a close second. I like Feed Wrangler's minimalist approach to RSS. However, the app is missing a few features that FeeddlerPro already has baked in.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Server-Side Synchronization</h3>

<p>Of course, an RSS client is nothing without the server-side to keep everything synchronized. I chose <a href="http://theoldreader.com">The Old Reader</a> because it syncs between iPhone, iPad, and web without extra fluff.</p>

<p>Other RSS providers probably offer the same level of service. Fortunately, Feeddler makes it easy to switch between RSS services seamlessly.</p>

<p>Google Reader is history, but RSS marches on.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-22T12:58:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella.jpg" width="450" height="257" alt="Parallella 64-core supercomputer" title="Parallella 64-core supercomputer" align="right" imgcap="Parallella Board">
The idea of owning a 64-core parallel system for two hundred dollars (yes, $200.00) is exciting. <a href="http://www.parallella.org/introduction/">Parallella</a> is working to make that happen, perhaps as early as August 2013. To prepare for that day, I've decided to introduce myself to the Go language.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What is Go?</h3>

<p><a href="http://golang.org">The Go language</a> is designed for parallel systems. Why does Go exist? One developer sums it up this way:</p>

<blockquote><p>Go was created at Google, by Google, for Google-size problems.<br/>~Dave Astels</p></blockquote>

<p>Google writes software that runs on thousands of machines in parallel. As the number of concurrent operations increases, new challenges are encountered. Google addressed those challenges by creating Go.</p>

<h3>Why Does a Rubyist Learn Go?</h3>

<p>The team at <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> writes web and mobile apps, mainly in Ruby. So why am I learning Go?</p>

<p>Because the best developers are polyglot. When we learn a new language, we cause ourselves to see old problems in new ways and we strengthen our ability to solve new problems. It's like cross-training for  athletes. In the end, we become better developers.</p>

<h3>How to Install Go on Mac OS X</h3>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list">Download the binary of Go that matches your system</a>, and complete the rest of these steps before installing it. For my 2010 i5-based 15-inch MacBook Pro, I chose <code>go1.1.1.darwin-amd64.pkg</code>. I was concerned about the reference to <code>amd64</code> in the name. But the description includes <code>Mac OS X (x86 64-bit)</code>, and the binary worked for me.</li>
<br/>
<li>If you are upgrading from a previous version of Go, you will need to remove the old Go directory. You can do this while the new binary is downloading in the background:</li>

```bash
$ rm -rf /usr/local/go
```

<li>Define the <code>GOROOT</code> and <code>GOPATH</code> environmental variables. My system uses <code>~/.bash_profile</code> to define environmental variables, so I added the following lines to the end of that file:

```bash
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
export GOPATH=~/Code/gocode
```
Note: I'm using the default <code>GOROOT</code> variable, but your <code>GOPATH</code> may differ from mine. I store all of my source code in a subdirectory of home:<code>~/Code</code>. My complete Go directory structure is given below. By looking at my structure, you can adjust these steps to fit your system.</li>
<br/>
<li>Tell your terminal session to recognize the new environmental variables. You can either restart terminal, or if your environmental variables are in <code>~/.bash_profile</code> like mine, you can do the following:</li>

```bash
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
<li>Run the package installation program, <code>go1.1.1.darwin-amd64.pkg</code>, that was downloaded in Step 1.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, let's Go for a test drive.</p>

<h3>Creating a Go Workspace</h3>

<p>Before you can run a Go program on your system, you have to create a Go workspace. A workspace is a directory structure that contains source code and binaries that a Go program needs in order to compile and execute.</p>

<p>We can examine the Go Workspace on my system with the Unix <code>tree</code> command:</p>

<p>```bash
~/Code/gocode$ tree
.
└── src</p>

<pre><code>└── github.com
    └── rayhightower
        └── hello
            └── hello.go
</code></pre>

<p>4 directories, 1 file</p>

<p>~/Code/gocode$
```</p>

<p>Here's a brief description of the directories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code = root directory for all source code on my system. Yours may differ.</li>
<li>gocode = where I store all of the Go code on my system. I'm following the structure recommended by the Go documentation. I may alter this as I learn more about the language.</li>
<li>src = source code</li>
<li>github.com = directory named after the place where I store repos</li>
<li>rayhightower = my GitHub profile name</li>
<li>hello = directory named for our first Go application</li>
<li>hello.go = the Go source file for our <code>Hello World</code> program</li>
</ul>


<p>All structure below the <code>gocode</code> directory is mandated by Go.</p>

<h3>Writing 'Hello World!' in Go</h3>

<p>Google's official installation instructions include a simple 'Hello World' program for testing the installation. A slightly modified version appears below:</p>

<p>```go
package main</p>

<p>import "fmt"</p>

<p>func main() {</p>

<pre><code>fmt.Printf("\n****** Hey Parallella enthusiasts: Learn Go! ******\n")
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h3>Compiling and Running</h3>

<p>We drop the code into a file called <code>hello.go</code> in the <code>hello</code> directory. To compile the program:</p>

<p>```bash
~/Code/gocode/src/github.com/rayhightower/hello$ go install</p>

<p>~/Code/gocode/src/github.com/rayhightower/hello$
<code>``
If the Go compiler responds with a blank prompt (like above) then the program compiled successfully and a</code>bin<code>directory has been created inside the Go workspace. Run the</code>tree<code>command from the</code>gocode` directory to see how the structure has changed:</p>

<p>```bash
~/Code/gocode$ tree
.
├── bin
│   └── hello
└── src</p>

<pre><code>└── github.com
    └── rayhightower
        └── hello
            └── hello.go
</code></pre>

<p>5 directories, 2 files</p>

<p>~/Code/gocode$
```</p>

<p>The newly created <code>bin/</code> directory contains our <code>hello</code> executable. And now, let's cut the suspense and <em>run the program</em>. To do so, change into the <code>bin/</code> directory and type <code>./hello</code>.</p>

<p>```bash
~/Code/gocode/src/github.com/rayhightower/hello$ cd ~/Code/gocode/bin</p>

<p>~/Code/gocode/bin$ ./hello</p>

<p><strong><strong><strong> Hey Parallella enthusiasts: Learn Go! </strong></strong></strong></p>

<p>~/Code/gocode/bin$
```
Success!</p>

<h3>It's Not Official, But It Makes Sense</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Parallella does not officially support the Go language. So why go through all of this trouble? Because...</p>

<ul>
<li>A 64-core Parallella is just too cool to pass up. And it's open source.</li>
<li>Go is designed for parallel systems. And it's open source.</li>
<li>Open source devs are working on a Go compiler for Parallella right now. If you're reading this, and you're one of the devs, thank you!</li>
</ul>


<p>The Go-Parallella match makes sense. It's always good to skate where the puck is going.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Now it's time to explore the Go language. The real adventure begins when the 64-core Parallella arrives. Looking forward to it!</p>
