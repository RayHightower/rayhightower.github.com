My primary code-writing tools are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> for Objective-C.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">Vim</a> for Ruby, <a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>, and everything else.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here are my reasons for using Vim, in priority order:</p>

<!--more-->


<ol>
<li><p>Vim is everywhere. I can find Vim on any &#39;nix-based machine: Unix, Linux, or OSX. I spend most of my time on OSX and the Ubuntu distribution of Linux. When I started experimenting with <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, it was pleasant to know that Vim was already there. Having a common editor on multiple platforms makes it easier to bounce between them.</p></li>
<li><p>Vim has history. I tried TextMate when I first heard about Ruby. Questions about TextMate's future caused me to look for an alternative. Vim's 20-year history and the <a href="http://www.vim.org/community.php">Vim community</a> convinced me that the editor would be available for many years to come.</p></li>
<li><p>Vim is fast. I laughed out loud the first time I saw<br/>
<code>NERDTree: Refreshing the root node. This could take a whileâ€¦ DONE</code><br/>
because it happened so quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Vim can be customized. If I want to tailor Vim for myself, I can do that through plugins and <code>.vimrc</code>. If I don't want to configure it myself, I can use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> by Carl Lerche and Yehuda Katz . You may choose a different course. Choices are powerful!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The developers I admire are always learning. More important: They are strategic about what they learn because learning takes time. Being productive with a highly available editor like Vim means that I don't have to spend time learning a new editor. Instead, I can focus my education in areas that benefit clients directly. That's why I use Vim.</p>
