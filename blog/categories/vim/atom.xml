    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a> includes a <code>rake</code> task that generates <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/whatis.html">Exuberant Ctags</a>. To generate tags, run the following in the root directory of a RubyMotion project.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rake ctags
</code></p>

<h4>Make Ctags Better With Automation</h4>

<p>Ctags make writing code more efficient. But we shouldn't have to type <code>$ rake ctags</code> every time we create a new RubyMotion project. This article shows how to use a shell script to generate ctags automatically every time you create a new RubyMotion app.</p>

<h4>How Ctags Save Time</h4>

<p>Ctags can save you time. For example, when creating a new class called <code>HomeViewController</code> that inherits from <code>UIViewController</code>, typing the first view characters of the superclass will produce the drop-down shown below.

<p>RubyMotion's implementation of ctags includes support for built-in iOS classes like UIViewController. The code completion and drop-downs offered by ctags will reduce keystrokes and errors, freeing the developer to focus on solving harder problems.</p>

<h4>Creating the Script</h4>

<p>Here's the script. You can use any name that suits you. My script is called <code>mmotion.command</code> (with two m's at the beginning to distinguish it from the standard <code>motion</code> command) and it's in the <code>~/bin/</code> directory.</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<h1>Create a RubyMotion app, change into the app's directory, and run ctags.</h1>

<h1>Written by Raymond T. Hightower on February 12, 2013</h1>

<p>echo "Creating a new RubyMotion app called:" $1
motion create $1
cd $1
echo "Creating ctags for the new RubyMotion app..."
rake ctags
echo "Opening the new app in Vim..."
mvim .
echo "To use the RubyMotion console, cd into the new directory:" $1
```
All of the work is done by by four lines. The remaining lines are comments or 'echos' that tell the user what's happening while the script is running.</p>

<h4>Running the Script</h4>

<p>If <code>~/bin/</code> is in the <code>$PATH</code>, you can run the script with the following line command:
<code>bash
$ mmotion.command [app name]
</code></p>

<p>Of course, we can still do better by leveraging the power of aliases in <code>~/.bash_profile</code>.</p>

<h4>Adding an Alias to ~/.bash_profile</h4>

<p>Dropping an alias into <code>~/.bash_profile</code> streamlines the process even more. You can use any alias you want as long as it doesn't confilct with another command. Here's what my alias looks like:</p>

<p><code>bash
alias mmotion="mmotion.command"
</code></p>

<h4>Taking the Script for a Spin</h4>

<p>Now we can build a new RubyMotion app called <code>NewApp</code> with these results:</p>

<p>``` bash
~/Code/Ruby/RubyMotion$ mmotion NewApp
Creating a new RubyMotion app called: NewApp</p>

<pre><code>Create NewApp
Create NewApp/.gitignore
Create NewApp/Rakefile
Create NewApp/app
Create NewApp/app/app_delegate.rb
Create NewApp/resources
Create NewApp/spec
Create NewApp/spec/main_spec.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Creating ctags for the new RubyMotion app...
Opening the new app in Vim...
To use the RubyMotion console, cd into the new directory: NewApp</p>

<p>~/Code/Ruby/RubyMotion$
```</p>

<p>After the bash script ends, it lands in the directory from which it was originally run, no matter what directories it changed to during execution. This script will open the new app in Vim when it's done.</p>

<p>From here, you can <code>$ cd NewApp</code> and type <code>rake</code> to run the app in the iOS simulator.</p>

<h4>Feedback Welcome</h4>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/vim-osx.png" width="300" height="257" alt="Vim on OSX" title="Vim on OSX" align="right"/>
My primary code-writing tools are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> for Objective-C.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">Vim</a> for Ruby, <a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>, and everything else.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here are my reasons for using Vim, in priority order:</p>

<!--more-->


<ol>
<li><p>Vim is everywhere. I can find Vim on any &#39;nix-based machine: Unix, Linux, or OSX. I spend most of my time on OSX and the Ubuntu distribution of Linux. When I started experimenting with <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, it was pleasant to know that Vim was already there. Having a common editor on multiple platforms makes it easier to bounce between them.</p></li>
<li><p>Vim has history. I tried TextMate when I first heard about Ruby. Questions about TextMate's future caused me to look for an alternative. Vim's 20-year history and the <a href="http://www.vim.org/community.php">Vim community</a> convinced me that the editor would be available for many years to come.</p></li>
<li><p>Vim is fast. I laughed out loud the first time I saw<br/>
<code>NERDTree: Refreshing the root node.</code><br/>
<code>This could take a whileâ€¦ DONE</code><br/>
because it happened so quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Vim can be customized. If I want to tailor Vim for myself, I can do that through plugins and <code>.vimrc</code>. If I don't want to configure it myself, I can use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> by Carl Lerche and Yehuda Katz . You may choose a different course. Choices are powerful!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The developers I admire are always learning. More important: They are strategic about what they learn because learning takes time. Being productive with a highly available editor like Vim means that I don't have to spend time learning a new editor. Instead, I can focus my education in areas that benefit clients directly. That's why I use Vim.</p>
