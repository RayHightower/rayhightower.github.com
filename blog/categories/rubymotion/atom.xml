<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Atari's Pong</a> is a classic video arcade game from the 1970s. Seeing Pong always gives me childhood flashbacks.</p>

<h4>Pong in Objective-C</h4>

<p>I recently completed the iOS Accelerated course at the <a href="http://mobilemakers.co/">Mobile Makers Academy</a>. For one of our homework assignments, we were asked to build a version of Pong that runs on iOS. Our instructor, <a href="http://twitter.com/dbora">Don Bora</a>, started us off with some skeleton code in Objective-C. Each student had to take Don's code and:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add paddles.</li>
<li>Make the paddles move on their own.</li>
<li>Make the ball bounce off the moving paddles.</li>
<li>Keep score.</li>
<li>Let one or two players control the paddles via touch.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h4>Questions to Consider</h4>

<p>How do you determine whether the pixels of the ball have collided with the pixels of a paddle? What about wall collisions? When a collision occurs, where should the ball bounce next? There are many details to consider.</p>

<h4>Building Blocks</h4>

<p>Of course, Don had already introduced the necessary skills in earlier lectures, labs, and homework. It was our job to put the pieces together.</p>

<p>Members of the class paired with each other, sharing solutions and advice. In time we each ended up with a working version of Pong in Objective-C. It's exciting to see a favorite childhood game running in the iOS simulator on your own machine, especially if you built the game yourself.</p>

<h4>Pong in RubyMotion</h4>

<p>Since my day job revolves around Ruby, it made sense to re-write the exercise in <a href="http://rayhightower.dev/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>. Here are video clips of my two solutions. The first was written in Objective-C during the Mobile Makers course. The second was written in RubyMotion.</p>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9LETiMdi9jQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe></center>




<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lt-JKqiA_fg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<p>As expected, the two solutions look similar. Source code is on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-oc">Pong in Objective-C</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-rm">Pong in RubyMotion</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>RubyMotion Gotchas</h4>

<p>I encountered a few RubyMotion snags during development:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Mousovers Ingored</em>. Normally, when running the simulator with RubyMotion, you can mouse over an object in the simulator, hit the command key, and grab a handle to the object.  This behavior was absent in landcape mode with version 1.31 of RubyMotion. The release notes for version 1.33 mention that the problem has been solved. However, that was not my experience.</li>
<li><em>Touch Events Ignored on Part of Screen</em>. For some reason, the simulator ignored touch events on the right side of the screen. When I programatically moved the right paddle closer to the left side of the screen, both paddles responded to touch events. Searches of Google and Stack Overflow reveal that others have encounterd the same issue with touch events, especially in landcape mode.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, I introduced a few bugs of my own while developing the Pong game. At one point, the velocity of the ball increased every time a player scored. It made the game exciting! But I didn't know the cause of the acceleration, and good developers strive to maintain better control over their projects.</p>

<p>I eventually found the acceleration problem: When using an NSTimer object to control animation, you have to invalidate the timer at the beginning of each cycle, or the animation will accelerate. That's a useful thing to know.</p>

<p>The rest of my work in RubyMotion went well, and I continue to enjoy the product. I plan to update the code once the touch event issues have been resolved.</p>

<h4>Why Play Games?</h4>

<p>Why should a serious developer spend time writing games? I can think of a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing a game challenges our skills on many levels. In the case of Pong, we have to dust off our old physics and geometry textbooks to ensure that the ball bounces like a real ball.</li>
<li>Writing a game lets us break out of our constraints. Devs who write business apps are very familiar with constraints.</li>
<li>Because writing a game is fun.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, the most important reason was given by a Captain of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701:</p>

<blockquote><p>The more advanced the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.
<br/>~James T. Kirk</p></blockquote>

<h4>Room for Improvement</h4>

<p>Building the Pong game was an interesting exercise in testing the capabilities of RubyMotion. Having gone done the work, I can look back and see some areas where I could improve the results. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated testing. These proof-of-concept exercises were done without automated testing. What is the best way to apply test driven development to a game? RubyMotion comes with a TDD framework, MacBacon. That would be a great subject for a future blog post.</li>
<li>Better design. Each exercise looks like something from the 1970s! How would Pong function if it was created in 2013?</li>
<li>Better collision detection. I'm using a built-in iOS method to detect ball collisions. The built-in detection works fine with the stationary walls, but not as well with the moving paddles. If I write a future version of Pong, I should also write a custom collision detection method.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Comments and Pull Requests</h4>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/02/12/automatic-ctags-with-rubymotion-and-vim/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-12T19:35:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/02/12/automatic-ctags-with-rubymotion-and-vim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a> includes a <code>rake</code> task that generates <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/whatis.html">Exuberant Ctags</a>. To generate tags, run the following in the root directory of a RubyMotion project.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rake ctags
</code></p>

<h4>Make Ctags Better With Automation</h4>

<p>Ctags make writing code more efficient. But we shouldn't have to type <code>$ rake ctags</code> every time we create a new RubyMotion project. This article shows how to use a shell script to generate ctags automatically every time you create a new RubyMotion app.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>How Ctags Save Time</h4>

<p>Ctags can save you time. For example, when creating a new class called <code>HomeViewController</code> that inherits from <code>UIViewController</code>, typing the first view characters of the superclass will produce the drop-down shown below.
<img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/uiviewcontroller.png" align="center" width="800" height="433" title="ctags RubyMotion Vim" alt="ctags RubyMotion Vim"></p>

<p>RubyMotion's implementation of ctags includes support for built-in iOS classes like UIViewController. The code completion and drop-downs offered by ctags will reduce keystrokes and errors, freeing the developer to focus on solving harder problems.</p>

<h4>Creating the Script</h4>

<p>Here's the script. You can use any name that suits you. My script is called <code>mmotion.command</code> (with two m's at the beginning to distinguish it from the standard <code>motion</code> command) and it's in the <code>~/bin/</code> directory.</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<h1>Create a RubyMotion app, change into the app's directory, and run ctags.</h1>

<h1>Written by Raymond T. Hightower on February 12, 2013</h1>

<p>echo "Creating a new RubyMotion app called:" $1
motion create $1
cd $1
echo "Creating ctags for the new RubyMotion app..."
rake ctags
echo "Opening the new app in Vim..."
mvim .
echo "To use the RubyMotion console, cd into the new directory:" $1
```
All of the work is done by by four lines. The remaining lines are comments or 'echos' that tell the user what's happening while the script is running.</p>

<h4>Running the Script</h4>

<p>If <code>~/bin/</code> is in the <code>$PATH</code>, you can run the script with the following line command:
<code>bash
$ mmotion.command [app name]
</code></p>

<p>Of course, we can still do better by leveraging the power of aliases in <code>~/.bash_profile</code>.</p>

<h4>Adding an Alias to ~/.bash_profile</h4>

<p>Dropping an alias into <code>~/.bash_profile</code> streamlines the process even more. You can use any alias you want as long as it doesn't confilct with another command. Here's what my alias looks like:</p>

<p><code>bash
alias mmotion="mmotion.command"
</code></p>

<h4>Taking the Script for a Spin</h4>

<p>Now we can build a new RubyMotion app called <code>NewApp</code> with these results:</p>

<p>``` bash
~/Code/Ruby/RubyMotion$ mmotion NewApp
Creating a new RubyMotion app called: NewApp</p>

<pre><code>Create NewApp
Create NewApp/.gitignore
Create NewApp/Rakefile
Create NewApp/app
Create NewApp/app/app_delegate.rb
Create NewApp/resources
Create NewApp/spec
Create NewApp/spec/main_spec.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Creating ctags for the new RubyMotion app...
Opening the new app in Vim...
To use the RubyMotion console, cd into the new directory: NewApp</p>

<p>~/Code/Ruby/RubyMotion$
```</p>

<p>After the bash script ends, it lands in the directory from which it was originally run, no matter what directories it changed to during execution. This script will open the new app in Vim when it's done.</p>

<p>From here, you can <code>$ cd NewApp</code> and type <code>rake</code> to run the app in the iOS simulator.</p>

<h4>Feedback Welcome</h4>

<p>If you notice any glitches with this approach, feel free to send me a "heads up" via the <a href="/contact/">contact</a> form on this site or in the blog comments below.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/26/rubymotion-provisioning-profiles/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-26T20:46:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/26/rubymotion-provisioning-profiles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This article on provisioning profiles was first posted in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubymotion/Nvo8dH_8rkI">RubyMotion Google Group</a> on May 10, 2012. It was also referenced on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13539743/rubymotion-build-error-cant-find-a-provisioning-profile-named-mixios-tea">Stack Overflow</a>.</em></p>

<p>Everything with RubyMotion worked great until I tried to run the sample apps on a physical device. And then I had to spend a few hours wrestling with provisioning profiles. Hopefully this post will save time for somebody else.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In order to successfully run a RubyMotion app on a non-jailbroken iPhone 3GS (via <code>$ rake device</code>) I had to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete all of the expired provisioning profiles in the Mac OS X Keychain Access app. Yeah, my past is littered with many random experiments :-)</li>
<li>Explicitly set the path to my provisioning profile in the rakefile for the app (the defaults didn't work for me).</li>
<li>Explicitly set the name of my codesign_certificate.</li>
</ul>


<p>The default "iOS Team Profile" didn't work for me. I had to set explicit values in my rakefile for the app. Here's my rakefile for the <a href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/Tweets">'Tweets' sample app</a>:</p>

<p><code>ruby
$:.unshift("/Library/RubyMotion/lib")
require 'motion/project'
Motion::Project::App.setup do |app| # Use `rake config' to see complete project settings.
  app.name = 'Tweets'
  app.provisioning_profile = '/Users/[username]/Library/ MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles/[string-of-numbers].mobileprovision'
  app.codesign_certificate = 'iPhone Developer: John Q Developer (A5QZ9QF4Z1)'
end
</code></p>

<p>Of course, my name isn't "John Q Developer", but you get the idea. Hope this helps!</p>

    <updated>2012-12-14T06:45:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/14/mobile-makers-objective-c-rubymotion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/ipad-iphone.jpg" width="256" height="250" alt="iPad iPhone" title="iPad iPhone" align="right">
This week I enrolled in the iOS Accelerated course offered by the <a href="http://mobilemakers.co/ios-accelerated">Mobile Makers Academy</a>. If you would like to do the same, mention my name and we'll both receive a $300 discount on tuition.</p>

<p>Class starts on Jan 7, 2013. The evening lectures are convenient for those who serve clients by day.</p>

<p>Of course, a tuition discount and easy schedule are poor reasons to enroll in a course. This article will describe my reasons for enrolling. If your thirst for learning is anything like mine, you might like Mobile Makers too.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Background and Expectations</h4>

<p>My background includes an undergrad degree in computer science. Over the years, I've coded in C, Lisp, Fortran, Pascal, x86 assembler, and Ruby. I became a "business guy" when I launched WisdomGroup eighteen years ago. WisdomGroup is fortunate to have a team of strong technologists who keep our clients happy while teaching me more every day.</p>

<p>In late 2011, I began to focus on sharpening my personal technical skills, and that led to my immersion in <a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a> this year. I expect the Mobile Makers experience to strengthen my grasp of Objective-C, OO theory, and iOS. Cross-training with Objective-C will boost my RubyMotion skills as well.</p>

<h4>Instruction Format</h4>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dbora">Don Bora</a> is the head instructor at Mobile Makers. Don is embarrassed when I say this, but he's the main reason why I chose to enroll. Don is a true polyglot programmer, with a background that includes Objective-C (of course!), C#, Java, Ruby, and Smalltalk among other languages. He currently builds Objective-C apps for his clients at <a href="http://eightbitstudios.com/">Eight Bit Studios</a>. Don holds degrees in computer science and linguistics.</p>

<p>Mobile Makers offers a learning format that is relatively new to me. Beyond the traditional classroom lectures, students get plenty of time for lab immersion and interaction with mentors. I first witnessed this format when Neal Sales-Griffin and Mike McGee launched <a href="http://starterleague.com">The Starter League</a>.</p>

<h4>More About Lab Time and Mentorship</h4>

<p>Classroom sessions are fine, but they're not enough. Can you learn a musical instrument by listening to lectures and taking notes? Mastering a skill like software development requires deliberate practice with challenging exercises. Learning is accelerated when lectures, labs, and mentorship complement each other.</p>

<h4>Learning Architecture</h4>

<p>Behind the scenes, Adam Lupu is the learning architect who designed the Mobile Makers curriculum. In Don's words: "I know how to explain things, but I don't know how to structure a course. That's where Adam comes in." Adam was the lead architect behind the Rails-based curriculum at the Starter League. Now he's building the mobile curriculum at Mobile Makers.</p>

<h4>Excitement</h4>

<p>The Mobile Makers <a href="http://mobilemakers.co/ios-accelerated">iOS Accelerated</a> class is only three weeks away. If you mention this blog post, you and I will both get a $300 tuition discount. More important, we will acquire skills that will serve us well as we solve problems for clients. What an exciting time to be a developer!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Special thanks to the organizers of <a href="http://magic-ruby.com/">MagicRuby</a> and <a href="http://aloharubyconf.com/">Aloha Ruby</a> for inviting me to present RubyMotion at their respective conferences. <a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/1245-aloharuby2012-building-ios-apps-with-rubymotion">Confreaks</a> recorded video at the Aloha Ruby event.</p>

<p>The fizzbuzz sample code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/fizzbuzzrm">GitHub</a>. Slides are on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rayhightower/building-ios-apps-with-rubymotion">SpeakerDeck</a>.</p>

<p>Should you use RubyMotion or Objective-C for iOS development? That depends...</p>

<!--more-->


<p>If your team is currently building web apps, and they happen to be Ruby-focused, then RubyMotion will enable you to create a <a href="http://rayhightower.com/blog/2012/08/31/four-steps-five-minutes/">minimum viable product (MVP)</a> using skills that you already have in-house. However, if your team is currently Objective-C focused, it may be easier for you to build your MVP in Objective-C.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that I am Ruby-biased, so I see advantages on the RubyMotion side of the question. Building the web <em>and</em> mobile pieces of an app in the same language means that expertise can be readily shared throughout the team. Shared expertise makes the team stronger.</p>

<p>Thanks again to MagicRuby and Aloha Ruby for asking me to speak, and to Confreaks for recording the talk.</p>
