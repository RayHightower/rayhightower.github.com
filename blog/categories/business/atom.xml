If you are fortunate enough to work in the technology industry, you do not need permission to move forward. So do it now.</p>

<p>Yes, you will have to define <em>it</em> for yourself.</p>

<h4>ChiPMA – Product Management</h4>

<p>A few years ago I had the pleasure of hearing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igsvMAU5POY">Suneel Gupta</a> speak at a Chicago Product Management Association meeting hosted by Pathfinder Development. Three points raised during Gupta’s talk:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conditions are never perfect. So start now.</li>
<li>What does <em>start</em> mean? Figure that out, and draw out the plan.</li>
<li>If you suck at first, keep going.</li>
<li>Conditions are never perfect.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Learning From History</h4>

<p>Gupta is a student of history. He began the talk by drawing parallels between today’s startup culture and the early days of powered flight.</p>

<p>In the late 1800s, Samuel Pierpont Langley was an accomplished engineer with great connections to money and resources. One of his lifelong goals was to develop a vehicle for powered flight. He built several successful models, hired the smartest collaborators he could find, and he even raised $50k (in 1898 dollars) from investors. Newspaper reporters followed his entourage as they conducted experiments. Surely, this team of thoroughbreds would solve the flight puzzle.</p>

<p>But most people have never heard of Langley. Somewhere in Ohio, far from the news outlets of the day, the Wright Brothers achieved the goal first. When Langley heard the news, he stopped trying.</p>

<p>Why did the Wright Brothers win? They never waited for perfect conditions. The Wright Brothers did what they could with the resources they had at the time. Maybe constraints are advantages in disguise.</p>

<h4>Draw Out the Plan</h4>

<p>Everybody has dreams. Something magical happens when we take the time to map out our dreams on paper.</p>

<p>Gupta’s example: Jack Dorsey, creator of Twitter. Dorsey drew the first mock-up for Twitter on paper. And then he showed it to people. Some laughed. Many gave feedback. He used the feedback to hone the idea into a viable product.</p>

<p>Until you put the idea on paper (or some other medium) so you can show it to potential customers and collaborators, you’ll never get the feedback you need to improve.</p>

<h4>Keep Going</h4>

<p>Gupta and his brother had an idea. They wanted to create videos about the first wave of Indians to move to America. They approached Hollywood experts about creating the videos.</p>

<p>"You’ll need at least $1 million," they were told. Much too expensive. Most people fold when facing a million dollar wall.</p>

<p>But Suneel and his brother made their own videos with the equipment they had available. The videos were not million-dollar productions. But here’s the upside: When they were done, they had something of substance that they could show to people. They posted their work at <a href="http://kahanimovement.com">KahaniMovement.com</a>. One viewer liked the site enough to send a link to Steven Spielberg.</p>

<p>Spielberg viewed the videos and he gave the brothers clear, actionable feedback. They made improvements. And they learned something interesting about Spielberg in the process: Even Spielberg starts with a loose cut sometimes! When Spielberg has a fresh idea that he’s trying to communicate, he will grab a hand-held camera, shoot the idea (no matter how rough) and show it to his team. If a picture is a thousand words, then a video is… you get the idea.</p>

<h4>Teachers &amp; Parents Ignite Our Passion</h4>

<p>Gupta shared a story about his 7th grade social studies class. The class watched a film of JFK delivering his inaugural speech in 1960. Gupta was moved. At the end of the film, the teacher informed that class that JFK had not written the speech. The author was Ted Sorensen, a man whom Kennedy called his <em>intellectual blood bank</em>.</p>

<p>In 7th grade, Gupta had found his calling. He would become a speech writer.</p>

<p>He went home and told his mother about his decision to become a speech writer. And that’s when his mother gave him a powerful piece of advice: "If you want to do that, you don’t have to wait. You can do it now."</p>

<p>You can do it now. What are you waiting for?</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/11/19/long-tail-opportunities/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-19T06:58:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/11/19/long-tail-opportunities</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You are already familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80/20_rule">80/20 rule</a>. In the late 1800s an Italian economist discovered that 80% of the wealth in his country was owned by 20% of the people. More recently we find that the 80/20 rule applies in other areas of our lives. Professional service firms find that eighty percent of the revenue comes from twenty percent of the clients. Merchants find that eighty percent of sales comes from twenty percent of the products. Winners at the very top of any field tend to win by a large margin.</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<h4>Another View of the 80/20 Rule</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html">The Long Tail</a> by Chris Anderson offers another way to look at the 80/20 rule. Our business example: A book store. The graph below shows book sales ranked by sales volume. Best-sellers are on the left side of the chart (in green) while slower sellers fill in the curve toward the right. Since shelf space is limited and expensive, the store only carries the most popular books along the left side of the chart. Smart application of the 80/20 rule, right? Maybe.</p>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/assets/TheLongTail.png" align="center" alt="The Long Tail" title="The Long Tail"></p>

<h4>The Long Tail: Everything Else</h4>

<p>High-volume books sell much more than other books. High-volume books (the short head) are the 20 percent that generate 80 percent of the revenue. The Long Tail is made up of everything else.</p>

<p>When a book store chooses to carry 20% of the available titles, how do they decide which 20% to carry? How do they predict the hits in advance?</p>

<p>Answer: They can't. Sometimes a sure hit fizzles into a dud, while a "sleeper" rockets to the best-seller list. A similar problem is faced by movie distributors, retail stores, and other businesses. How do you profit from hits that you cannot predict?</p>

<h4>The Long Tail in 1897</h4>

<p>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. is one of the oldest Long Tail companies in the USA. If you wanted to buy a product in late 1800's America, you would visit the general store. Most Americans lived on farms at that time, so visiting the store meant riding into town. Product selection was limited to the items on the store shelf. Shopping for a better price meant traveling to the next town -- a tough journey in the days before automobiles.</p>

<p>Sears entered the scene in 1897. Launching in the middle of the railroad boom gave Sears access to a cheap delivery system for both suppliers and customers. Efficient warehouses located at the country's busiest railroad hub, Chicago, maximized their distribution leverage. The result: The cozy general store system was disrupted by the Sears catalog, 786-pages filled with more products and better prices.</p>

<p>Note that the Sears catalog did not put the general store completely out of business. Impulse buyers still shopped at the general store. But Sears certainly shook things up by making Long Tail products available for everybody.</p>

<h4>The Long Tail in 1994</h4>

<p>In 1994 a math geek named Jeff Bezos was reviewing Internet investment opportunities. Bezos observed that book sellers were expanding their physical stores, but none were expanding on the web. He smelled an opportunity. Bezos believed that a new distribution system (the web) could make a wider selection (the Long Tail) available to the world. Amazon.com was born.</p>

<p>Sears launched in the middle of the railroad boom, and Bezos launched Amazon.com in the middle of the first Internet boom. Sears benefited from inexpensive distribution via railroads, while Amazon distributes its catalog virtually free via the web. Great business ideas often repeat themselves.</p>

<h4>The Long Tail Today</h4>

<p>Do you remember record stores? Record stores had a problem -- limited shelf space. Store managers had to figure out which records to stock by predicting (in advance) which records would sell best -- the 80/20 rule again.</p>

<p>Some people argue that record stores were destroyed by free music downloads. However, "free" was only part of the problem. The bigger challenge came from the wider selection (Long Tail) offered through music downloads. In January 2009, Apple announced that over six billion songs had been downloaded through iTunes at 99 cents each. Apple's distribution costs are virtually zero thanks to iTunes.</p>

<p>Apple found abundant opportunities in the Long Tail of music distribution. Video entertainment is next.</p>

<h4>What About the Crud?</h4>

<p>Some argue that there is a reason why some products are in the Long Tail instead of the short head: If you consider the entire spectrum of any product type, a large percentage of it is crud. The music industry is one example. True, the "better" music gets recorded by a large music studio or played on radio stations. But the Long Tail is full of music that never made it that far -- from the amateur taking his first lesson to the garage band with great musical skills and bad marketing.</p>

<p>Of course, one person's crud is another person's masterpiece. Musical tastes vary widely. The Long Tail works in the digital music business because it makes tiny niches of music available to people who want them.</p>

<h4>The Long Tail Future</h4>

<p>Given the success of Long Tail companies (like Sears, Amazon, and Apple) one might wonder if there are any Long Tail opportunities left in our economy. The answer is yes! Anderson argues that a Long Tail company needs to do two things to succeed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a wide selection available, from the short head and the Long Tail.</li>
<li>Help customers find what they want.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Everything, Easy to Find</h4>

<p>If you make everything available, customers could become annoyed if they have to sift through it. So we have to make it easy for them to find exactly what they want.</p>

<p>Sears made everything available through railroads, and they solved the sifting problem with the Sears catalog. The catalog served as a convenient way for customers to find the products they wanted.</p>

<p>Amazon's recommendation software is wonderful -- unless you're a customer trying to save money! The engine examines a customer's past purchases and uses that information to suggest future purchases. Human clerks have done the same thing for centuries. But Amazon's software does it faster with  zero vacation days.</p>

<p>Apple makes everything available and easily searchable through iTunes.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>History shows that Long Tail opportunities tend to coincide with the introduction of disruptive technologies. Railroads and the Internet are two examples. Sears could not have existed in catalog form before railroads. Amazon could not have offered the long tail of book selection without the Internet. In both cases, the advent of a faster &amp; cheaper distribution system was a catalyst for a powerful new business model.</p>

<p>Are there any Long Tail opportunities left in today's marketplace? Yes. And the next Long Tail enterprise might be launched by you.</p>

<h4>Suggested Reading</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Revised-Updated-Edition-ebook/dp/B000JMKSE2">The Long Tail</a>, by Chris Anderson. The drastic reduction in the cost of distribution for digital information has far-reaching effects upon our economy. As a result, some businesses will thrive while others will die.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/11/10/make-your-competition-irrelevant/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-10T02:55:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/11/10/make-your-competition-irrelevant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/assets/blue_ocean_strategy.png" align="right" alt="Blue Ocean Strategy" title="Blue Ocean Strategy"></p>

<h4>Path to Victory</h4>

<p>A skillfully executed business strategy is one path to victory. Many strategy books will tell business owners how to win at the expense of the competition, how to take market share away from the competition, and so on.</p>

<p>The book <em>Blue Ocean Strategy</em> proposes a non-typical path to victory over the competition. According to the authors, following a blue ocean strategy will make your competition irrelevant.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Competitive Red Oceans</h4>

<p>First, some definitions. The authors divide the business world into two oceans: red and blue. Red oceans are markets where competition is stiff and companies battle fiercely. The ocean is red with the blood of business gladiators who cut each other to shreds with competing offerings. Margins tend to be low because customers have many identical options to choose from. Customers view red ocean products as commodities.</p>

<h4>Undiscovered Blue Oceans</h4>

<p>But blue oceans are undiscovered markets. Blue ocean companies offer products and services that are so full of value that customers pay premium prices for the better value. Competition is scarce (and the water remains blue) because blue ocean markets tend to be new. Few companies have figured out how to find the blue ocean. Customers are pleased because blue ocean offerings contain features beyond those found in typical (red ocean) products. Customers willingly pay higher prices for the increased value found in blue ocean products.</p>

<blockquote><p>Blue ocean products deliver more value, therefore
customers are willing to pay more
to have them.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Example: Red Ocean Circus</h4>

<p>Say the word “circus” to a person of a certain age and they will immediately think “Ringling Brothers.” The Ringling Brothers Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus owned the American circus market for decades. Small regional players competed for crumbs. But by the 1980’s, circus audiences were shrinking and even Ringling Brothers had trouble keeping pace. Kids who once begged their parents for circus tickets wanted the latest computer games instead. The market, as a whole, was struggling for new customers and revenue was on the decline.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, expenses were increasing. Animals eat every day and food prices continue to rise. Animals require trainers, and trainers require salaries. Circus “stars” demand star treatment in an industry where the customers, accustomed to Hollywood celebrities, no longer find the stars of the circus impressive.</p>

<p>In short, the circus industry was a red ocean. Revenue was on the decline as costs continued to rise. Profits were squeezed.</p>

<h4>Blue Ocean Circus</h4>

<p>But a Montreal street performer had a bold new idea. Create a new kind of circus. Eliminate animals and eliminate the cost of feeding them. Avoid “star” performers in favor of an ensemble cast including former Olympic athletes. Direct the marketing focus toward a completely new clientele: adults instead of kids. Recognize that adult customers will pay more money for a higher level of entertainment. Build elements of high-end entertainment (such as Broadway theatre) into the new “circus.”</p>

<p>The result: A brand new blue ocean in the form of Cirque du Soleil. The Montreal street performer, Guy Laliberte, achieved billionaire status through his new blue ocean. Another benefit: Customers willingly travel to places like Las Vegas to see Cirque du Soleil. So performers spend less time on the road than they would with a “traditional” circus. Performers enjoy a higher quality of life because they spend less time away from home and more time with their families. Some benefits, like this, are more important than any financial upside.</p>

<h4>Another Red Ocean: Intimidating Wine</h4>

<p>Wine drinkers know that the process appears intimidating and pretentious to the novice buyer. Personally, I know little of the industry jargon: I’ve picked up words like “vintage” and “legs” but beyond that, I’m clueless. And I’m not alone. An Australian wine company, Casella Wines, discovered that millions of prospective customers were as clueless as me.</p>

<blockquote><p>If the market has already been defined by
your competitors, you are operating in a red ocean.
Why play a game created and dominated by your competitors? Successful
blue ocean companies never battle incumbents head-on.
They re-write the rules.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Blue Ocean: Inviting Wine</h4>

<p>Casella wines decided to challenge the entire industry with a brand new wine, [yellow tail]. Casella could have sold its product to the existing population of wine buyers (red ocean). However, strategists at the company tapped latent demand for wine among non-wine buyers, people who avoided wine because they didn’t want to learn all the mumbo jumbo. People like beer drinkers, a market three times the size of wine drinkers. So [yellow tail] was marketed without all of the typical focus on vintages, years, etcetera.</p>

<p>The result: [yellow tail] discovered a blue ocean of new customers. People who had rarely bought wine before began to buy [yellow tail]. Yes, [yellow tail] wooed customers away from their competitors, but it’s more important to note that they grew the entire wine market. The new brand continues to grow aggressively in an industry previously thought to be mature.</p>

<h4>Red Oceans and Old Rules</h4>

<p>If you’re running an aggressive company, and the market has already been defined by your competitors, you are operating in a red ocean. Who says you need to compete there? Why play a game created and dominated by your competitors? Successful blue ocean companies never battle incumbents head-on. They re-write the rules.</p>

<h4>The Next Blue Ocean: Where?</h4>

<p>If blue oceans are so great, where do we find them? What industries offer the best blue ocean opportunities? Which companies are best at finding blue oceans in existing industries?</p>

<p>Through their study of many industries and companies, the authors learned that there are no permanently excellent companies, and no permanently excellent industries. Blue ocean examples can be found in mature (or presumed dead) industries such as circus entertainment and dinner wine. One key to discovering the next blue ocean is something called value innovation.</p>

<h4>Value Innovation</h4>

<p>Value innovation is delivering a product or service in a manner that is both creative and relevant to the customer.</p>

<p>Value without innovation leads to minor incremental improvement. In the circus example, adding more animals might add value, but only in a same-old-stuff kind of way.</p>

<p>Innovation without value tends to be futuristic. Technology for technology’s sake. Although customers may find the innovation fascinating, they won’t pay for it without value. An example: Personal computers in the 1970’s. PCs were innovative, but they didn’t deliver value until the creation of useful business applications like electronic spreadsheets (Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Excel) and email.</p>

<p>Value innovation is a fruitful marriage between value and innovation. It’s delivering something creative that customers care about and will pay for. Value innovation is not necessarily cutting edge. Elements of Cirque du Soleil are seen in other forms of entertainment. [yellow tail] is not the first wine ever sold.</p>

<p>Rather, both of these examples combine value and innovation in creative ways. Each attracts new customers (adults, non-wine drinkers), eliminates things that add no value (animals, intimidation &amp; pretentiousness), and add elements that customers are willing to pay for (drama, fun beverages).</p>

<h4>That’s Not All</h4>

<p>A two-page newsletter cannot cover everything in Blue Ocean Strategy. The authors, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne, include many more example companies and frameworks for navigating your company to the next blue ocean.</p>

<h4>Caution: Have a Plan</h4>

<p>He who ventures beyond his current red ocean without a plan will wind up in a puddle. The authors caution against pursuing blue oceans based on gut instinct. Have a plan, and wear a life vest!</p>
