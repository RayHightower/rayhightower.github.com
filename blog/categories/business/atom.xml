<em>Note: This timeless story pre-dates the web, and it has appeared at <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup.com</a>. Author unknown.</em></p>

<p>There was a man who lived by the side of the road and sold hot dogs. He was hard of hearing, so he had no radio. He had trouble with his eyes, so he read no newspaper. But he sold good hot dogs. He put signs up on the highway telling how good they were. He stood on the side of the road and cried "Buy a hot dog, mister?" And people bought. He increased his meat and bun orders. He bought a bigger stove to take care of his trade.</p>

<p>One day, his son came home from college to help him out. <!--more--> The son said, "Father, haven’t you been listening to the radio? Haven’t you been reading the newspaper? There’s a big recession. The European situation is terrible. The domestic situation is worse."</p>

<p>Whereupon the father thought, "Well, my son has been to college. He reads the papers and listens to the radio. He ought to know."</p>

<p>So the father cut down on his meat and bun orders, took down his advertising signs, and no longer bothered to stand out on the highway to sell his hot dogs.</p>

<p>Hot dog sales fell almost overnight.</p>

<p>"You’re right, son," the father said. "We are certainly in the middle of a great recession."</p>

<h4>Epilogue</h4>

<p>Whether times are good or bad, all of us must ask ourselves: What role is played by self-fulfilling prophesy?</p>

<p>Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/moth.png" width="300" height="215" align="right" title="Emperor moth photo by Dean Morley" alt="Emperor moth photo by Dean Morley">
A man found a cocoon of an emperor moth. He took it home so that he could watch the moth come out of the cocoon. On the day a small opening appeared, he sat and watched the moth for several hours as the moth struggled to force its body through that little hole.</p>

<p>Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and it could go no farther. It just seemed to be stuck.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Kindness</h4>

<p>Then the man, in his kindness, decided to help the moth, so he took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The moth then emerged easily. But it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings. The man continued to watch the moth because he expected that, at any moment, the wings would enlarge and expand to be able to support the body, which would contract in time. Neither happened! In fact, the little moth spent the rest of its life crawling around with a swollen body and shriveled body and shriveled wings. It never was able to fly.</p>

<h4>Helping vs. Understanding</h4>

<p>What the man in his kindness and haste did not understand was that the restricting cocoon and the struggle required for the moth to get through the tiny opening was the way of forcing fluid from the body of the moth into its wings so that it would be ready for flight once it achieved its freedom from the cocoon. Freedom and flight would only come after the struggle. By depriving the moth of a struggle, he deprived the moth of health.</p>

<h4>Obstacles and Growth</h4>

<p>Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If we were to go through our life without any obstacles, we would be crippled. We would not be as strong as what we could have been. Give every opportunity a chance, and leave no room for regrets.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/do_it_now.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="296" alt="You Can Do It Now" title="You Can Do It Now">
If you are fortunate enough to work in the technology industry, you do not need permission to move forward. So do it now.</p>

<p>Yes, you will have to define <em>it</em> for yourself.</p>

<h4>ChiPMA – Product Management</h4>

<p>A few years ago I had the pleasure of hearing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igsvMAU5POY">Suneel Gupta</a> speak at a Chicago Product Management Association meeting hosted by Pathfinder Development. Three points raised during Gupta’s talk:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conditions are never perfect. So start now.</li>
<li>What does <em>start</em> mean? Figure that out, and draw out the plan.</li>
<li>If you suck at first, keep going.</li>
<li>Conditions are never perfect.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h4>Learning From History</h4>

<p>Gupta is a student of history. He began the talk by drawing parallels between today’s startup culture and the early days of powered flight.</p>

<p>In the late 1800s, Samuel Pierpont Langley was an accomplished engineer with great connections to money and resources. One of his lifelong goals was to develop a vehicle for powered flight. He built several successful models, hired the smartest collaborators he could find, and he even raised $50k (in 1898 dollars) from investors. Newspaper reporters followed his entourage as they conducted experiments. Surely, this team of thoroughbreds would solve the flight puzzle.</p>

<p>But most people have never heard of Langley. Somewhere in Ohio, far from the news outlets of the day, the Wright Brothers achieved the goal first. When Langley heard the news, he stopped trying.</p>

<p>Why did the Wright Brothers win? They never waited for perfect conditions. The Wright Brothers did what they could with the resources they had at the time. Maybe constraints are advantages in disguise.</p>

<h4>Draw Out the Plan</h4>

<p>Everybody has dreams. Something magical happens when we take the time to map out our dreams on paper.</p>

<p>Gupta’s example: Jack Dorsey, creator of Twitter. Dorsey drew the first mock-up for Twitter on paper. And then he showed it to people. Some laughed. Many gave feedback. He used the feedback to hone the idea into a viable product.</p>

<p>Until you put the idea on paper (or some other medium) so you can show it to potential customers and collaborators, you’ll never get the feedback you need to improve.</p>

<h4>Keep Going</h4>

<p>Gupta and his brother had an idea. They wanted to create videos about the first wave of Indians to move to America. They approached Hollywood experts about creating the videos.</p>

<p>"You’ll need at least $1 million," they were told. Much too expensive. Most people fold when facing a million dollar wall.</p>

<p>But Suneel and his brother made their own videos with the equipment they had available. The videos were not million-dollar productions. But here’s the upside: When they were done, they had something of substance that they could show to people. They posted their work at <a href="http://kahanimovement.com">KahaniMovement.com</a>. One viewer liked the site enough to send a link to Steven Spielberg.</p>

<p>Spielberg viewed the videos and he gave the brothers clear, actionable feedback. They made improvements. And they learned something interesting about Spielberg in the process: Even Spielberg starts with a loose cut sometimes! When Spielberg has a fresh idea that he’s trying to communicate, he will grab a hand-held camera, shoot the idea (no matter how rough) and show it to his team. If a picture is a thousand words, then a video is… you get the idea.</p>

<h4>Teachers &amp; Parents Ignite Our Passion</h4>

<p>Gupta shared a story about his 7th grade social studies class. The class watched a film of JFK delivering his inaugural speech in 1960. Gupta was moved. At the end of the film, the teacher informed that class that JFK had not written the speech. The author was Ted Sorensen, a man whom Kennedy called his <em>intellectual blood bank</em>.</p>

<p>In 7th grade, Gupta had found his calling. He would become a speech writer.</p>

<p>He went home and told his mother about his decision to become a speech writer. And that’s when his mother gave him a powerful piece of advice: "If you want to do that, you don’t have to wait. You can do it now."</p>

<p>You can do it now. What are you waiting for?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All of us are inspired when we have a big goal to achieve. Antoine De Saint-Exupery expresses the idea well:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, encourage them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.</p></blockquote>

<p>2013 is already proving to be an exciting year. Looking forward to more.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WisdomGroup is hiring a <a href="https://jobs.chicagoruby.org/jobs/100">web design intern</a>. Our current volume of work requires it. The ideal candidate will share our beliefs about design, summarized as...</p>

<blockquote><p>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. ~Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>

<p>Great design is functional and inspiring. Autodesk captures the idea in this ad from several years ago:</p>

<center><iframe name="autodesk" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jrK4rTkKLDg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Text from the Autodesk ad:</p>

<blockquote><p>For every serious challenge facing the world there is someone with a big idea. That big idea needs to be nurtured. It needs to be explored and analyzed in order to bring it to life.</p>

<p>And design is at the core of that innovation.</p>

<p>Our technology gives innovators the ability to see how their ideas perform and behave. To exprience it before it's real.</p>

<p>There isn't a problem in the world that a great designer can't solve.</p></blockquote>
