Today is Sunday. I'm reflecting on a quote I just became aware of this week:

>Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences.
>
>~Freeman Dyson, English Physicist

Well said, Freeman Dyson. Praise God for technology.
