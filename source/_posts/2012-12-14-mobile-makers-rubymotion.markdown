This week I enrolled in the iOS Accelerated course offered by the Mobile Makers Academy. If you would like to do the same, mention my name and we'll both receive a $300 discount on tuition. Class starts on Jan 7, 2013. 

Of course, a tuition discount is a poor reason to enroll in a course. This article will describe my reasons for enrolling. If your motivations are anything like mine, you might want to sign up too.

####Background and Expectations
My background includes an undergrad degree in computer science. Over the years, I've coded in C, Fortran, Pascal, x86 assembler, and Ruby. I became a "business guy" when I launched WisdomGroup eighteen years ago. WisdomGroup is fortunate to have a team of strong technologists who keep our clients happy while teaching me more every day. 

In late 2011, I began to focus on sharpening my personal technical skills, and that led to my immersion in RubyMotion this year. I expect the Mobile Makers experience to strengthen my grasp of Objective-C, OO theory, and RubyMotion. 

####Instruction Format
Don Bora is the head instructor at Mobile Makers. Don is embarrassed when I say this, but he's the main reason why I chose Mobile Makers. Don is a true polyglot programmer, currently immersed in Objective-C projects for his clients at [Eight Bit Studios](http://eightbitstudios.com/). Don will lead the lectures, and he will lead the lab sessions twice per week. What an opportunity for mentorship!

Mobile Makers offers a learning format that is relatively new to me. Beyond the traditional classroom lectures, students get plenty of time for lab immersion and interaction with mentors. I first witnessed this format when Neal Sales-Griffin and Mike McGee launched [The Starter League](http://starterleague.com). 

####More About Lab Time
Classroom sessions are fine, but they're not enough. Can you learn a musical instrument by listening to lectures and taking notes? Mastering a skill like software development requires deliberate practice with challenging exercises. Learning is accelerated when lectures and labs complement each other. 

####Learning Architecture
Behind the scenes, Adam Lupu is the learning architect who designed the Mobile Makers curriculum. In Don's words: "I know how to explain things, but I don't know how to structure a course. That's where Adam comes in." Adam was the lead architect behind the Rails-based curriculum at the Starter League. Now he's building the mobile curriculum at Mobile Makers.
