This post is long overdue!

Alexis Finch ([@agentfin](https://twitter.com/agentFin)) created Sketch Notes for a RubyMotion presentation that I gave for [Groupon's Geekfest](http://meetup.com/geekfest). 

Alexis is remarkable. It's challenging enough to capture text notes during a presentation. But Alexis managed to turn the talk into meaningful graphics in real time. Something amazing is happening between the ears of Alexis!

Sketchnotes were invented by Mike Rohde ([@rohdesign](http://twitter.com/rohdesign)). Mike has published videos and a book describing the [process of creating Sketchnotes](http://rohdesign.com/sketchnotes/).

Thank you Alexis and Mike for sharing your artistic insights, and thank you Groupon for having me at Geekfest.
