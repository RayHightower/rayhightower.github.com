####Parallels Gotcha
I'm running Kali Linux inside of Parallels version on Mac OS X Mountain Lion. I ran into a gotcha while getting Kali Linux to run in Parallels.  The Linux installation proceeded normally, but when I rebooted the system, Linux wouldn't come up. Instead, I got the error message

```bash

```
Google is our friend! Through google, I found the solution on a blog called [redrise](http://redrise.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/installing-kali-in-parallels-desktop-7/).
