It's gratifying to know that learning something tangentially related to Ruby will, in fact, teach me more about Ruby. 

[_Working With Unix Processes_](http://workingwithunixprocesses.com/), by Jesse Storimer, is ostensibly about Unix internals. However, in reading this book, I have become more aware of how executables run on my favorite family of operating systems, which in turn gives me more insight into Ruby.

For exampleâ€¦

There are a few typos in the book. Of course, a quick Google search with the errant block of code as a search term leads the reader to the relevant errata. For example, early in the book I had problems with the command that returns the maximum number of processes allowed

on a system. Turns out there was a simple error, and the corretion was posted by the author himself on a Prag Prog errata page for the book.
