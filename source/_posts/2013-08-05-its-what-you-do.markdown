Cleaning my office, I found the following in a stack of old papers. This
was published in the _Wall Street Journal_ sometime in the 1980s.

Ted Williams, at age 42, slammed a home run in his last official at bat.
Mickey Mantle, age 20, hit 23 home runs in his first full year in the major leagues.
Goda Meir was 71 when she became Prime Minister of Israel.
William Pitt II was 24 when he became Prime Minister of Great Britain.
George Bernard Shaw was 94 when one of his plays was first produced.
Mozart was just seven when his first composition was published.
Now, how about this? Benjamin Franklin was a newspaper columnist at 16, and a framer of The United States Constitution when he was 81.

You're never too young or too old if you've got talent. Let's recognize
that age has little to do with ability.
