Today I was invited to speak at the June [Table Talks](http://www.tablexi.com/blog/2013/06/developer-education-june-table-talks/developers/) hosted by Table XI. Topic: _Practice Begins With Play_. Developers who want to achieve mastery have many resources to choose from, including open source hardware like [Raspbery Pi](/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/), [BeagleBone Black](), and [Parallella](http://parallella.org).
