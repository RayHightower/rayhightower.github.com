Jobs insisted that Apple focus on just two or three priorities at a time. "There is no one better at turning off the noise that is going on around him," Cook said. "That allows him to focus on a few things and say no to many things. Few people are really good at that." <br/><br/>~Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs

The WisdomGroup and ChicagoRuby teams have hosted three conferences per year since 2010. WindyCityRails, WindyCityDB, and WindyCityGo are exciting and _exhausting_. In the midst of conference management, ChicagoRuby hosts three events every month and WisdomGroup has clients to serve. Scrambling in so many areas makes it hard to focus. Time to fix that.

ChicagoRuby will produce one conference in 2013: WindyCityRails. You can purchase pre-launch tickets today at [http://windycityrails.com/2013](http://windycityrails.com/2013). Use the code "FOCUS" for a special rate, good through September 30, 2012.

We will continue to produce three monthly events: Two events downtown and one
in Elmhurst. By keeping everything Ruby-focused, we can &lt;businessmumbojumbo&gt; leverage synergies and
achieve economies of scale &lt;/businessmumbojumbo&gt;.

###Mobile Recap: WindyCityGo
WindyCityGo 2012 received the highest ratings of any conference we've ever run. Why would we abandon something so successful? In a word, focus. Running WindyCityGo means branching out and nurturing relationships with a wide specturm of developers: iOS, Android, Windows Phone. Each mobile community is full of bright, motivated people. Trying to please everybody means pulling ourselves away from our primary Ruby focus. Time to regroup. 

###NoSQL Recap: WindyCityDB
WindyCityDB was my favorite conference this year (I'm writing this blog post before WindyCityRails). Surveys tell us that the audience enjoyed it too. This year we featured only four NoSQL databases with plenty of hands-on time for each. This new, experimental format proved successful. You can expect to see some variation of this in a future WindyCityRails.

###Recommendations for 2013
Now that ChicagoRuby is shifting back to a Ruby/Rails focus on conferences, what are some available options? I have personal experience with the following events, and if the organizers choose to host these next year, they're worth a look: 

<table>
<tr><td width=50>&nbsp;<td>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cocoaconf.com/">CocoaConf</a>, a multi-city event hosted by Dave Klein and his team. I attended CocoConf in 2012 and I loved it. Specifically, I was impressed with CocoaConf's focus on OS X and iOS development. Focus yields excellence.</li> 
<li><a href="http://secondconf.com">SecondConf</a>, locally-organized iOS and OS X conference. Some of the speakers have apps chosen by Apple as demos in their retail stores. If you can't make it to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a>, go to SecondConf. Note that SecondConf tickets sell out almost as fast as WWDC.</li> 
<li><a href="http://10gen.com">10gen</a>, creator of MongoDB, has hosted multi-city events around their NoSQL platform. Historical note: A MongoDB presentation in Feb 2010 inspired ChicagoRuby to launch WindyCityDB.</li> 
<li><a href="http://www.couchbase.com/couchconf-world-tour">CouchConf World Tour</a> is a multi-city event that focuses on Couchbase. From what I've learned of NoSQL, it is always good to review several alternatives so that you can match the right tool to your particular data challenge.</li> 
<li><a href="http://madisonruby.org">MadisonRuby</a> attracts great speakers and the organizers get the whole city involved in the conference: Restauranteurs, professional musicians, cheese specialistsâ€¦ you name it. I attended the first two years, and I plan to return in 2013.</li> 
</ul>
</td></tr>

###One Conference in 2013: WindyCityRails
The bottom line: ChicagoRuby will focus its conference energy on
WindyCityRails in 2013, and we will continue to host the three monthly events. Each year has been larger and more successful than the last. Thank you for making that possible. 

See you at [WindyCityRails 2013](http://windycityrails.org/2013)!
