The decision to cancel Google Reader was disappointing. I read most of my news via RSS, and the ability to sync multiple RSS clients between iPhone, iPad, and desktop with Google's Reader in the background was convenient. But now it's time to move on.

Today I installed [Feed Wrangler](http://feedwrangler.net) by independent developer [David Smith](http://david-smith.org/apps/). Here are my first impressions. 

####Pros
I like Feed Wrangler's minimalist approach. 
* Feed Wrangler contains minimal fluff and distraction, and I like that. Other RSS clients feature big photos and special page-flipping effects. That's not for me. Just the facts, RSS.
* Feed Wrangler imports RSS feeds from Google Reader with minimal effort. 
* Feed Wrangler is a paid app. Google dropped Reader (ostensibly) because they couldn't make any money from the free product. You can't fix that with volume! Contrast that with Feed Wrangler at $18.99 per year. Revenue-generating apps are more likely to stick around.
* Native apps for iPhone and iPad. Very important because I consume most RSS on-the-go.

####Cons
Like most users, I want the developer to add "just one or two more features" to make it ideal for me. Of course, since every user has a different set of one-or-two features, the software could turn into bloatware if the developer tries to please everybody.

Here's what I would like to see:
* Evernote integration. Feedler lets me drop an article into Evernote with a few taps on the screen. 
* While Feed Wrangler imports feeds from Google Reader, it does not maintain Reader's organization. So I had to organize my feeds manually with Feed Wrangler's "Smart Stream" feature. If Reader's folders could be imported as Feed Wrangler's Smart Streams, that would be cool.

####Summary
I plan to try other RSS readers before July 1, 2013, the shut-down date for Google Reader. Feed Wrangler has made a good impression on me so far.
