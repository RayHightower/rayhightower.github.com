The decision to cancel Google Reader was disappointing. I consume most news via RSS, and the ability to sync multiple RSS clients between iPhone, iPad, and desktop with Google Reader in the background saved time while keeping me informed. 

Fortunately, strong alternatives are emerging. [Feed Wrangler](http://feedwrangler.net) is a Google Reader replacement by independent developer [David Smith](http://david-smith.org). Here are my first impressions.

####Pros
After using the service for a few hours, I can already see some things that I like. Specifically:

* Minimal fluff. Other RSS clients feature big photos and special page-flipping effects. That's not for me. Just the facts, RSS.
* Easy RSS import from Google Reader. Just log in with your Google account and follow the prompts. After you import your feeds into Feed Wrangler's web app, you will never need Google Reader again. 
* Reasonable cost. The Feed Wrangler service costs $19/year. Google dropped Reader because they couldn't make money from the free product. You can't fix that with volume! When an app makes money (directly or indirectly) then the app is more likely to stick around.
* Mobile companions. Feed Wrangler's native apps for iPhone and iPad are very important because I consume most RSS on-the-go.

####Cons
Like most users, I want the developer to add "just one or two more features" to make the app perfect for me. Of course that's the slippery slope to bloatware since every user has a different set of one-or-two features.

The developer can avoid bloatware by ignoring all other users and focusing on my feature requests: 

* Evernote integration. My current RSS client lets me drop an article into Evernote with a few taps on the screen.  
* Organized imports. While Feed Wrangler imports feeds from Google Reader, it does not maintain Reader's organization. So I had to organize my feeds manually with Feed Wrangler's "Smart Stream" feature. If Reader's folders could be imported as Feed Wrangler's Smart Streams, that would be cool.

####Summary
I plan to try other RSS readers before Google Reader shuts down on July 1st. Feed Wrangler is making a good impression so far.
