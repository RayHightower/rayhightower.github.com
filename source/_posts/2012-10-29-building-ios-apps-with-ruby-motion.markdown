Special thanks to the organizers of [MagicRuby](http://magic-ruby.com/) and [Aloha Ruby](http://aloharubyconf.com/) for inviting me to present RubyMotion at their respective conferences. [Confreaks](http://confreaks.com/videos/1245-aloharuby2012-building-ios-apps-with-rubymotion) recorded video from the Aloha Ruby.

Should you use RubyMotion or Objective-C for iOS development? That depends...
<!--more-->
If your team is currently building web apps, and they happen to be Ruby-focused, then RubyMotion will enable you to create an [MVP](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2012/08/31/four-steps-five-minutes/) using skills that you already have in-house. However, if your team is currently Objective-C focused, you can go ahead and build your app in Objective-C.

Keep in mind that I am Ruby-biased, so I see this advantage for the RubyMotion side of the question: A team that stays focused on one language and one environment over time will get very good with that language/environment. There is always an advantage in having strong expertise.

Slides from the talk are available on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/rayhightower/building-ios-apps-with-rubymotion) and here on [RayHightower.com](http://rayhightower.com/presentations/).

Thank you again MagicRuby and Aloha Ruby for asking me to speak!
