The organizers of [MagicRuby](http://magic-ruby.com/) and [Aloha
Ruby](http://aloharubyconf.com/) were kind enough
to invite me to present RubyMotion at their respective
conferences. [Confreaks](http://confreaks.com/videos/1245-aloharuby2012-building-ios-apps-with-rubymotion) recorded the Aloha Ruby event on video.

Should you use RubyMotion or Objective-C for iOS development?
<!--more-->
In my opinion, that depends on the skillset of your development team.
If your team is Ruby-focused, then RubyMotion will enable you to
create an [MVP](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2012/08/31/four-steps-five-minutes/) using skills that you already have. However, if your team is currently Objective-C focused, you may want to build your MVP using that set of tools.
