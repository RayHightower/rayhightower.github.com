All of us are inspired when we have a big goal to pursue. I need to be reminded of this quote from Antoine De Saint-Exupery time to time:

>If you want to build a ship, donâ€™t drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.

2013 has already proven to be an exciting year. Looking forward to more.
