    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a> is on a mission. Technology enables us to form communities that stretch beyond traditional boundaries like age and social status. Godin is convinced that revolutions within and between communities will yield huge opportunities for those who have the courage to take action. Don’t waste the revolution!</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to hear Godin speak at a Chicago area event some time ago. This post was inspired by the presentation.</p>

<h3>Recognizing Change</h3>

<p>Humans rarely recognize change when we’re in the middle of it. We’re too busy living! One example from Chicago history: The advent of the skyscraper. On the surface, a skyscraper is just a tall building… big deal. However, in hindsight we can see that the skyscraper (and the Chicago school of architecture) in the late 1880s led to the expansion of cities. Cities became magnets for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge workers</a>. As cities grew to accommodate more people, political power shifted away from farms and toward urban areas. Professional service firms, companies that exist to make other companies better, blossomed &amp; grew. We continue to feel the effects of this trend today, over a century later.</p>

<p>Godin believes that we are now dealing with another catalyst of change, one that is even more powerful than the skyscraper: the community. Communities are growing in size and power. Companies that know how to leverage communities are thriving.</p>

<h3>Threadless is Not About T-Shirts</h3>

<p>Fast forward to the early 21st century where we find a Chicago-area company called Threadless. If you sell a product that is easily copied, how do you differentiate yourself from the competition? By selling something that goes beyond the easily cloned product. <a href="http://threadless.com/">Threadless</a> has created a community around T-shirt sales. When building the company, the founders of Threadless looked at available technology and asked themselves, “What do people really want?” Their answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>To be famous.</li>
<li>To be recognized.</li>
<li>To be talked about.</li>
</ul>


<p>So they built the company to fulfill these basic human needs. If you’re an artist, submit a design. If enough people vote for your design, it gets printed on a shirt. And while you’re looking around the Threadless site, you’re welcome to buy any of the other designs for about $20 each.</p>

<p>While other t-shirt companies are trying to undercut each other on price, Threadless gives customers what they really want, customers gladly pay a premium, and everybody wins.</p>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/rails_logo.jpg" width="200" height="285" align="right" title="Ruby on Rails Logo" alt="Ruby on Rails Logo"></p>

<h3>We Don’t Pay for Software. We Pay for Results</h3>

<p>Godin cites <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> as an example of a company that nutures a community of software developers by giving away software for free. 37signals extracted the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> web framework from their Basecamp project management tool. Rather than charge for Rails, the company makes it available to the open source community at no charge. 37signals benefits because the people who use Rails, software developers, end up trying, buying and recommending the paid products to their colleagues. This results in an upward spiral in revenue for the company. To top it off, 37signals benefits from the open source community in ways that are not easily measured in dollars.</p>

<p>WisdomGroup is grateful to the entire Ruby on Rails community, including 37signals. We express our gratitude through <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> and <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a>. Contributing to the open source community has enabled us to develop wonderful relationships with contractors, clients, advisors… all sorts of people who have helped us to grow &amp; prosper. User groups and conferences enable the software community to come together – creating something far beyond the grasp of an individual genius.</p>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>

<p>Seth Godin’s point at today’s seminar: Our most successful companies are built around communities. Companies that know how to build &amp; nurture communities will thrive &amp; grow. Companies stuck in the old paradigm (massive advertising on a massive scale) might survive, but they will be easily eclipsed by companies that understand the value of strong communities. The revolution is here, and Seth Godin urges all of us not to waste it.</p>

align="right" alt="FeeddlerPro Accounts" title="FeeddlerPro Accounts">
Yes, the name appears misspelled. But <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feeddler-rss-reader-pro/id365710282?mt=8">FeeddlerPro</a> is my choice for RSS on iPhone and iPad. Feeddler has long been my favorite RSS reader. The developer&#8217;s decision to add support for services beyond Google Reader (Bazqux Reader, FeedHQ, and The OldReader) sealed the decision for me.</p>

<h3>Second Choice</h3>

<p><a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/21/replacing-google-reader-with-feed-wrangler/">Feed Wrangler</a> was a close second. I like Feed Wrangler&#8217;s minimalist approach to RSS. However, the app is missing a few features that FeeddlerPro already has baked in.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Server-Side Synchronization</h3>

<p>Of course, an RSS client is nothing without the server-side to keep everything synchronized. I chose <a href="http://theoldreader.com">The Old Reader</a> because it syncs between iPhone, iPad, and web without extra fluff.</p>

<p>Other RSS providers probably offer the same level of service. Fortunately, Feeddler makes it easy to switch between RSS services seamlessly.</p>

<p>Google Reader is history, but RSS marches on.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-22T12:58:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella.jpg" width="450" height="257" alt="Parallella 64-core supercomputer" title="Parallella 64-core supercomputer" align="right" imgcap="Parallella Board">
The idea of owning a 64-core parallel system for two hundred dollars (yes, $200.00) is exciting. <a href="http://www.parallella.org/introduction/">Parallella</a> is working to make that happen, perhaps as early as August 2013. To prepare for that day, I&#8217;ve decided to introduce myself to the Go language.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What is Go?</h3>

<p><a href="http://golang.org">The Go language</a> is designed for parallel systems. Why does Go exist? One developer sums it up this way:</p>

<blockquote><p>Go was created at Google, by Google, for Google-size problems.<br/>~Dave Astels</p></blockquote>

<p>Google writes software that runs on thousands of machines in parallel. As the number of concurrent operations increases, new challenges are encountered. Google addressed those challenges by creating Go.</p>

<h3>Why Does a Rubyist Learn Go?</h3>

<p>The team at <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> writes web and mobile apps, mainly in Ruby. So why am I learning Go?</p>

<p>Because the best developers are polyglot. When we learn a new language, we cause ourselves to see old problems in new ways and we strengthen our ability to solve new problems. It&#8217;s like cross-training for  athletes. In the end, we become better developers.</p>

<h3>How to Install Go on Mac OS X</h3>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list">Download the binary of Go that matches your system</a>, and complete the rest of these steps before installing it. For my 2010 i5-based 15-inch MacBook Pro, I chose <code>go1.1.1.darwin-amd64.pkg</code>. I was concerned about the reference to <code>amd64</code> in the name. But the description includes <code>Mac OS X (x86 64-bit)</code>, and the binary worked for me.</li>
<br/>
<li>If you are upgrading from a previous version of Go, you will need to remove the old Go directory. You can do this while the new binary is downloading in the background:</li>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rm -rf /usr/local/go
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<li>Define the <code>GOROOT</code> and <code>GOPATH</code> environmental variables. My system uses <code>~/.bash_profile</code> to define environmental variables, so I added the following lines to the end of that file:

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">GOROOT</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/local/go
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span>:<span class="nv">$GOROOT</span>/bin
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">GOPATH</span><span class="o">=</span>~/Code/gocode
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
Note: I&#8217;m using the default <code>GOROOT</code> variable, but your <code>GOPATH</code> may differ from mine. I store all of my source code in a subdirectory of home:<code>~/Code</code>. My complete Go directory structure is given below. By looking at my structure, you can adjust these steps to fit your system.</li>
<br/>
<li>Tell your terminal session to recognize the new environmental variables. You can either restart terminal, or if your environmental variables are in <code>~/.bash_profile</code> like mine, you can do the following:</li>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bash_profile
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<li>Run the package installation program, <code>go1.1.1.darwin-amd64.pkg</code>, that was downloaded in Step 1.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, let&#8217;s Go for a test drive.</p>

<h3>Creating a Go Workspace</h3>

<p>Before you can run a Go program on your system, you have to create a Go workspace. A workspace is a directory structure that contains source code and binaries that a Go program needs in order to compile and execute.</p>

<p>We can examine the Go Workspace on my system with the Unix <code>tree</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~/Code/gocode<span class="nv">$ </span>tree
</span><span class='line'>.
</span><span class='line'>└── src
</span><span class='line'>    └── github.com
</span><span class='line'>        └── rayhightower
</span><span class='line'>            └── hello
</span><span class='line'>                └── hello.go
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>4 directories, 1 file
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~/Code/gocode<span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here&#8217;s a brief description of the directories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code = root directory for all source code on my system. Yours may differ.</li>
<li>gocode = where I store all of the Go code on my system. I&#8217;m following the structure recommended by the Go documentation. I may alter this as I learn more about the language.</li>
<li>src = source code</li>
<li>github.com = directory named after the place where I store repos</li>
<li>rayhightower = my GitHub profile name</li>
<li>hello = directory named for our first Go application</li>
<li>hello.go = the Go source file for our <code>Hello World</code> program</li>
</ul>


<p>All structure below the <code>gocode</code> directory is mandated by Go.</p>

<h3>Writing &#8216;Hello World!&#8217; in Go</h3>

<p>Google&#8217;s official installation instructions include a simple &#8216;Hello World&#8217; program for testing the installation. A slightly modified version appears below:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='go'><span class='line'><span class="k">package</span> <span class="n">main</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">import</span> <span class="s">&quot;fmt&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;\n****** Hey Parallella enthusiasts: Learn Go! ******\n&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Compiling and Running</h3>

<p>We drop the code into a file called <code>hello.go</code> in the <code>hello</code> directory. To compile the program:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~/Code/gocode/src/github.com/rayhightower/hello<span class="nv">$ </span>go install
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~/Code/gocode/src/github.com/rayhightower/hello<span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If the Go compiler responds with a blank prompt (like above) then the program compiled successfully and a <code>bin</code> directory has been created inside the Go workspace. Run the <code>tree</code> command from the <code>gocode</code> directory to see how the structure has changed:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~/Code/gocode<span class="nv">$ </span>tree
</span><span class='line'>.
</span><span class='line'>├── bin
</span><span class='line'>│   └── hello
</span><span class='line'>└── src
</span><span class='line'>    └── github.com
</span><span class='line'>        └── rayhightower
</span><span class='line'>            └── hello
</span><span class='line'>                └── hello.go
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>5 directories, 2 files
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~/Code/gocode<span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The newly created <code>bin/</code> directory contains our <code>hello</code> executable. And now, let&#8217;s cut the suspense and <em>run the program</em>. To do so, change into the <code>bin/</code> directory and type <code>./hello</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~/Code/gocode/src/github.com/rayhightower/hello<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Code/gocode/bin
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~/Code/gocode/bin<span class="nv">$ </span>./hello
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>****** Hey Parallella enthusiasts: Learn Go! ******
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~/Code/gocode/bin<span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Success!</p>

<h3>It&#8217;s Not Official, But It Makes Sense</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Parallella does not officially support the Go language. So why go through all of this trouble? Because&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>A 64-core Parallella is just too cool to pass up. And it&#8217;s open source.</li>
<li>Go is designed for parallel systems. And it&#8217;s open source.</li>
<li>Open source devs are working on a Go compiler for Parallella right now. If you&#8217;re reading this, and you&#8217;re one of the devs, thank you!</li>
</ul>


<p>The Go-Parallella match makes sense. It&#8217;s always good to skate where the puck is going.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Now it&#8217;s time to explore the Go language. The real adventure begins when the 64-core Parallella arrives. Looking forward to it!</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>I was inspired to explore Go by <a href="https://twitter.com/blakesmith">Blake Smith&#8217;s</a> presentation at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoSC/events/120658422/">8th Light</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/wondible">Justin Love</a> introduced me to Parallella last month at ChicagoRuby.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/21/replacing-google-reader-with-feed-wrangler/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-21T18:52:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/21/replacing-google-reader-with-feed-wrangler</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/feedwrangler-gil.jpg" height="600" width="450" align="right" alt="Google Reader Replacement: Feed Wrangler - iPad" title="Google Reader Replacement: Feed Wrangler - iPad">
Google Reader, the RSS product, shuts down on July 1st. I consume most news via RSS, and the ability to sync multiple RSS clients between iPhone, iPad, and desktop with Google Reader in the background saved time while keeping me informed. Finding a replacement is critical.</p>

<p>Fortunately, strong alternatives are emerging. <a href="http://feedwrangler.net">Feed Wrangler</a> is a Google Reader replacement by independent developer <a href="http://david-smith.org">David Smith</a>. Here are my first impressions.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Pros</h3>

<p>After using the service for a few hours, I can already see some things that I like. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimal fluff. Other RSS clients feature big photos and page-flipping special effects. That&#8217;s not for me. Just the facts, RSS.</li>
<li>Easy RSS import from Google Reader. Just log in with your Google account and follow the prompts. After you import your feeds into Feed Wrangler&#8217;s web app, you will never need Google Reader again.</li>
<li>Reasonable cost. The Feed Wrangler service costs $19/year. Google dropped Reader because they couldn&#8217;t make money from the free product. You can&#8217;t fix that with volume! When an app makes money (directly or indirectly) then the app is more likely to stick around.</li>
<li>iPhone and iPad apps. Feed Wrangler&#8217;s native apps for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feed-wrangler/id634486174?mt=8">iPhone and iPad</a> sync with the web app. This is important for me because I consume most RSS on-the-go. A screenshot from the iPad app appears above.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cons</h3>

<p>Like most users, I want the developer to add &#8220;just one or two more features&#8221; to make the app perfect for me. Of course that&#8217;s the slippery slope to bloatware since every user has a different set of one-or-two features.</p>

<p>The developer can avoid bloatware by ignoring all other users and focusing on <em>my</em> feature requests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Evernote integration. My current RSS client lets me drop an article into Evernote with a few taps on the screen. Sometimes I want to re-read an article or think about it more deeply at a later time. Evernote lets me do this.</li>
<li>Organized imports. While Feed Wrangler imports feeds from Google Reader, it does not maintain Reader&#8217;s organization. So I had to organize my feeds manually with Feed Wrangler&#8217;s &#8220;Smart Stream&#8221; feature. If Reader&#8217;s folders could be imported as Feed Wrangler&#8217;s Smart Streams, that would be cool.</li>
<li>Feed counter. Sometimes I prioritize my reading by the number of unread articles. A counter next to each feed would be helpful.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I plan to try other RSS readers before Google Reader shuts down on July 1st. Feed Wrangler is making a good impression so far.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/31/kali-linux-pentesting/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-31T00:15:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/31/kali-linux-pentesting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/kali-linux-desktop.png" width="400" height="303" title="Kali Linux - The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear." alt="Kali Linux - The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear." align="right">
<a href="http://getbraintree.com">Braintree</a> hosted a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/braintreepayments/events/119511632/">Hax &#8216;n Snax</a> event this afternoon. Devs from around Chicago gathered together to hack on code, socialize, trade ideas, and hone skills. Thanks Braintree for putting on a great event.</p>

<p>My Hax &#8216;n Snax time was spent interacting with other devs and experimenting with a Linux distro that I just discovered, Kali Linux.</p>

<h3>What is Kali Linux?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.kali.org/">Kali</a> is a fairly new Linux distro designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. If you&#8217;re looking for a general purpose Linux distro, <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> would be a better choice. Kali is the successor of BackTrack. The developers of Kali and BackTrack, <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Software</a>, state that &#8220;Kali is a more mature, secure, and enterprise-ready version of BackTrack Linux.&#8221; You can download it at <a href="http://kali.org">Kali.org</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Parallels Installation Gotcha</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m running Kali Linux inside of Parallels version 7 on Mac OS X 10.8.3 (Mountain Lion). The Linux installation proceeded normally, but when I rebooted the virtual machine, Linux wouldn&#8217;t come up. Instead, I got the perpetual display of timeouts shown below.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/time-out.png" width="754" height="645" title="Kali Linux time out" alt="Kali Linux time out" align="center"></center>


<p>Google led me to a solution on a blog called <a href="http://redrise.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/installing-kali-in-parallels-desktop-7/">redrise</a>. The solution: To make Kali run on Parallels, uncheck the check box labeled &#8220;Show battery in Linux&#8221;, as shown below.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/show-battery-in-linux.png" width="798" height="653" title="Kali - Show battery in Linux" alt="Kali - Show battery in Linux" align="center"></center>


<p>I&#8217;m not sure why a battery indicator would prevent Kali from booting in Parallels, but the solution worked. When I installed Kali on VMWare, the OS ran without special configuration changes.</p>

<h3>The Kali Linux Tools</h3>

<p>Kali comes with over 300 penetration tools. It&#8217;s open source, so if you see room for improvement, <a href="http://git.kali.org/gitweb/">fork the repo</a> and go to work. If your ideas are strong enough, the developers might accept your pull request. There&#8217;s even a version of Kali for <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>. Take a look at the GUI.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/kali-linux-security-tools.png" width="798" height="653" title="Kali Linux Security Tools" alt="Kali Linux Security Tools" align="center"></center>


<h3>Using Wireshark on Kali Linux</h3>

<p>Kali includes sniffer tools that can capture WiFi traffic. If the WiFi traffic is &#8220;protected&#8221; (note the quotes) with an older method like wireless encryption protocol (WEP), Kali&#8217;s tools can crack the encryption.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/wireshark-kali-linux.png" width="600" height="492" title="Kali Linux Wireshark" alt="Kali Linux Wireshark" align="center"></center>


<p>A screenshot from Wireshark appears above. Wireshark sits and observes network traffic. If a packet looks interesting, drill down to discover the packet&#8217;s source, destination, and contents.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Kali enables developers and network professionals to protect themselves and their clients from attacks. Kali is powerful, and with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-22T22:13:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack.jpg" width="372" height="600" title="BeagleBone Black" alt="BeagleBone Black" align="right">
<a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">BeagleBone Black</a>, like the <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, is a small, inexpensive computer that runs Linux. It&#8217;s smaller than a deck of cards and you can buy one for about forty-five dollars ($45.00). The device is made by <a href="http://circuitco.com">CircuitCo</a> in Richardson, TX, USA.</p>

<h3>It Just Works</h3>

<p>BeagleBone Black runs Linux right out of the box. Steps required:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plug in the micro-HDMI cable for the monitor. See the &#8220;Gotchas&#8221;
section about micro-HDMI below.</li>
<li>Plug in the keyboard &amp; mouse via the USB port. You might need a USB hub because the board only has one USB port.</li>
<li>Add power via the mini-USB port or the 5v power connection.</li>
</ul>


<p>After a few minutes of boot time, we have a fully-functioning Linux computer with a GUI, Firefox browser, and other tools.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The BeagleBone Black has 2GB of flash storage on the board, and part
of that is used for Linux. Here&#8217;s a screenshot after just a few minutes of ownership.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack-WindyCityRails.png" width="600" height="338" title="BeagleBone Black Firefox WindyCityRails" alt="BeagleBone Black Firefox WindyCityRails" align="center"></center>


<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack-USB.png" width="250" height="200" title="BeagleBone Black USB" alt="BeagleBone Black USB" align="right">
All of the paper documentation for the BeagleBone Black fits on a slip of paper roughly the size of two business cards. The meat of the documentation resides on the device itself. To reach the electronic documentation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Plug the BeagleBone Black into a USB port on your laptop.</li>
<li>The board will appear as a USB storage device. One of the files at the
root of the storage device, <code>START.htm</code>, contains the documentation. It
can be viewed in a web browser.</li>
</ol>


<p>The documentation recommends against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">MSIE</a>.</p>

<h3>Gotchas</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/micro-HDMI-home-depot.jpg" width="400" height="300" title="Micro HDMI Home Depot" alt="Micro HDMI Home Depot" align="right">
The manufacturer included a mini-USB cable with the device, so you can power it up right after you rip open the package. Gotcha: You need a micro-HDMI cable (or adapter) if you want to attach a monitor. I would have preferred a micro-HDMI-to-HDMI adapater in the box instead of the mini-USB cable. That&#8217;s a little nit-picky on my part since micro-HDMI cables are easy to find at Home Depot.</p>

<p>A quick shout-out to Home Depot: Their store-brand cables let you test the cable end without opening the package, right in the store. Excellent package design by Home Depot.</p>

<p>My second &#8220;gotcha&#8221; is more important: The <code>curl</code> command did not behave as flawlessly as it did with the Raspberry Pi, so I was not able to install Ruby as quickly as planned. Details below.</p>

<h3>Installing Rails</h3>

<p>I will have to cover Ruby and Rails installation in a future blog post because my initial attempts were not successful. <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">RVM, Ruby, and Rails installed easily with Raspberry Pi</a>, even though the compilation time was long. With the BeagleBone Black, I received the following in response to the <code>curl</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>sh-4.2#
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Maybe it&#8217;s time to try <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBEnv</a>? I&#8217;ll post a solution when I find it. Or&#8230; if a reader of this blog already has a solution for the BeagleBone Black Rails installation challenge, please post in the comments below and I&#8217;ll credit you here.</p>

<h4>BeagleBone Black vs. Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>Which is better, BeagleBone Black or Raspberry Pi? There&#8217;s no clear winner in my opinion. It&#8217;s a matter of trade-offs:</p>

<ul>
<li>The &#8216;Bone runs Linux right out of the box, while it takes some time to get Linux running on the Pi, unless you buy a card pre-configured for the Pi.</li>
<li>RVM, Ruby, and Rails installation was painless on the Pi even though compilation time was long. The jury is still out w/r/t RVM on the &#8216;Bone.</li>
<li>Cost-wise, they&#8217;re within ten bucks of each other. That&#8217;s a wash.</li>
<li>The &#8216;Bone has more Ardunio-like provisions for digital projects.</li>
<li>The Pi includes an RCA output for older TVs. Plus the Pi uses standard HDMI, so there&#8217;s no need to get a special micro-HDMI cable.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ve owned my &#8216;Bone for just over 24 hours. Lots more to learn. Looking forward to it!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-16T13:36:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rvm.io">Ruby Version Manager (RVM)</a> is one of my favorite tools in the Ruby ecosystem.  Reason: RVM lets me experiment with Ruby and Rails at will. I don&#8217;t know about you, but my best experiments are full of risk so they eventually blow things up. When that happens, I can always recover the broken areas without wasting time on a full system restore.</p>

<p>Some devs choose to use another tool, <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBenv</a>, that serves a purpose similar to RVM. I began working with RVM before the other tools existed, and since it has always worked well for me, I have no reason to switch.</p>

<h4>Ruby 2.0.0-p195</h4>

<p>The latest patch of Ruby 2.0.0, p195, was released two days ago. Time to take it for a spin. RVM lets devs upgrade Ruby and manage gemsets seamlessly. Here&#8217;s how the process went.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Get the Latest RVM</h4>

<p>Instructions for installing RVM are at <a href="http://rvm.io">http://rvm.io</a>.
If you already have RVM installed, you should confirm that you have the
latest version.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm get head
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Grab the Ruby Patch</h4>

<p>With the latest RVM installed, you can upgrade to the latest Ruby
patch level.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm upgrade 2.0.0
</span><span class='line'>Are you sure you wish to upgrade from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195? <span class="o">(</span>Y/n<span class="o">)</span>: y
</span><span class='line'>Installing new ruby ruby-2.0.0-p195
</span><span class='line'>Searching <span class="k">for </span>binary rubies, this might take some time.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The process took at least twenty minutes on my system. I don&#8217;t have an exact time because I began working on other tasks during the upgrade, and when I looked back at the terminal window, the process was mostly complete, except for a few questions about gemsets&#8230;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Migrating gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195
</span><span class='line'>Are you sure you wish to MOVE gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195?
</span><span class='line'>This will overwrite existing gems in ruby-2.0.0-p195 and remove them from ruby-2.0.0-p0 <span class="o">(</span>Y/n<span class="o">)</span>: y
</span><span class='line'>Moving gemsets...
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&#8230;and aliases, wrappers, and archiving my patchless Ruby 2.0.0.</p>

Alexis Finch (<a href="https://twitter.com/agentFin">@agentfin</a>) captured Sketchnotes for a <a href="http://rayhightower.com/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a> presentation that I gave for <a href="http://meetup.com/geekfest">Groupon&#8217;s Geekfest</a>.</p>

<p>Sketchnotes are typography and drawing and notes all mixed together.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Alexis is remarkable. It&#8217;s challenging enough to capture text notes during a presentation. But Alexis managed to turn the talk into meaningful graphics in real time. Something amazing is happening between the ears of Alexis!</p>

<p>Mike Rohde (<a href="http://twitter.com/rohdesign">@rohdesign</a>) developed Sketchnotes when he became frustrated with note-taking. Mike is the go-to guy for anything related to Sketchnotes. He has published videos and a book <a href="http://rohdesign.com/sketchnotes/">describing the process</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you Alexis and Mike for sharing your artistic insights, and thank you Groupon for having me at Geekfest.</p>

<p>There was a man who lived by the side of the road and sold hot dogs. He was hard of hearing, so he had no radio. He had trouble with his eyes, so he read no newspaper. But he sold good hot dogs. He put signs up on the highway telling how good they were. He stood on the side of the road and cried &#8220;Buy a hot dog, mister?&#8221; And people bought. He increased his meat and bun orders. He bought a bigger stove to take care of his trade.</p>

<p>One day, his son came home from college to help him out. <!--more--> The son said, &#8220;Father, haven’t you been listening to the radio? Haven’t you been reading the newspaper? There’s a big recession. The European situation is terrible. The domestic situation is worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon the father thought, &#8220;Well, my son has been to college. He reads the papers and listens to the radio. He ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the father cut down on his meat and bun orders, took down his advertising signs, and no longer bothered to stand out on the highway to sell his hot dogs.</p>

<p>Hot dog sales fell almost overnight.</p>

<p>&#8220;You’re right, son,&#8221; the father said. &#8220;We are certainly in the middle of a great recession.&#8221;</p>

<h4>Epilogue</h4>

<p>Whether times are good or bad, all of us must ask ourselves: What role is played by self-fulfilling prophesy?</p>

<p>Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/ack.png" align="right" height="237" width="230" alt="Ack Linux Mac OS X" title="Ack Linux Mac OS X"></p>

<p><a href="http://beyondgrep.com/">Ack</a> is an open source command line tool that lets developers search large trees of source code very quickly. If you are looking for a method definition in a haystack of files, Ack will find that needle for you. Many devs regard Ack as a replacement for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>.</p>

<p>The Elmhurst <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> meetings are always a source of unexpected learning. Today ChicagoRuby welcomed <a href="http://twitter.com/petdance">Andy Lester</a>, creator of Ack. Andy released Ack 2.0 two days ago. He shared some of the latest features in an impromptu demo.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Why Ack?</h4>

<p>Have you ever been working on a project, only to be interrupted when you need to look for something? It could be a method name, a variable declaration, or a string of text in a comment. A minor distraction costs you the time it takes to search plus the time required to re-focus.</p>

<p>All of us are more productive when we stay <em>in the zone</em>. Ack helps devs to maintain focus and thereby produce better results.</p>

<h4>First, Install Perl</h4>

<p>Ack requires the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a> programming language. Perl comes pre-installed on Mac OS X and most Linux distros. If you&#8217;re running on a &#8216;nix platform, you probably have Perl already.</p>

<p>Windows installations are beyond the scope of this article. If you&#8217;re running Windows, you might consider a Linux VM for Ruby and Rails-related work.</p>

<h4>Installing Ack on Mac OS X</h4>

<p>Installing Ack is so easy that it almost feels wrong: Grab Ack in a single Perl file and drop it in your <code>~/bin/</code> directory. That&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>Ack can also be installed via <a href="http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>, but I prefer the <em>drop it in ~/bin</em> installation since everything is contained in one file. Here&#8217;s a more detailed version of the steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have one already, create <code>~/bin/</code> as a subdirectory of your home directory.</li>
<li>Grab a the single-file copy of Ack from <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/">http://beyondgrep.com/ </a></li>
<li>Drop the single-file copy of Ack into a file called <code>~/bin/ack</code></li>
<li>Make sure that <code>$HOME/bin:</code> appears at the beginning of your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable.</li>
</ol>


<p>At this point you should be running Ack v2.0 or later. To verify:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~/bin<span class="nv">$ </span>ack --version
</span><span class='line'>ack 2.02 <span class="o">(</span>git commit f3c8827<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>Running under Perl 5.12.4 at /usr/bin/perl

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~/bin<span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Installation complete. Now, let&#8217;s take Ack for a spin.</p>

<h4>Using Ack at the Command Line</h4>

<p>For a sample project, let&#8217;s use <code>demo_app</code> from Michael Hartl&#8217;s <a href="http://rubyonrailstutorial.com">Ruby on
Rails Tutorial</a>. Imagine that you want
to find every file in the project that references <code>user_id</code>. How would
you do that?
<img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/ack_user_id.png" align="center" height="650" width="887" alt="Ack command line demo" title="Ack command line demo"></p>

<p>Fast, clear, and highlighted in color. Bonus: If you&#8217;re a Vim user,
try <a href="https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim">ack.vim</a> if you want to run Ack
without leaving your editor.</p>

<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>

<p>Ack helps devs to find things quicker without leaving the zone. Try it!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/04/18/new-rvm-behavior-ruby-version-ruby-gemset/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-18T20:33:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/04/18/new-rvm-behavior-ruby-version-ruby-gemset</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/04/18/new-rvm-behavior-ruby-version-ruby-gemset/"><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/rvm.png" height="98" width="89" align="right" alt="RVM .ruby-version .ruby-gemset" title="RVM .ruby-version .ruby-gemset"></a>
I trust <a href="http://rvm.io">RVM</a> to manage my Ruby versions and my gemsets. So when I saw an unexpected change in RVM&#8217;s behavior, I was concerned about a possible disruption in my workflow.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>A New RVM Message</h4>

<p>Here&#8217;s the message I received when I changed into <code>mydirectory/</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~/Code/Ruby/apps/<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>mydirectory/
</span><span class='line'>You are using <span class="s1">&#39;.rvmrc&#39;</span>, it requires trusting, it is slower and it is not
</span><span class='line'>compatible with other ruby managers, you can switch to <span class="s1">&#39;.ruby-version&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>using <span class="s1">&#39;rvm rvmrc to [.]ruby-version&#39;</span> or ignore this warnings with
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">&#39;rvm rvmrc warning ignore ~/Code/Ruby/apps/mydirectory/.rvmrc&#39;</span>,
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">&#39;.rvmrc&#39;</span> will <span class="k">continue </span>to be the default project file in RVM 1 and RVM 2,
</span><span class='line'>to ignore the warning <span class="k">for </span>all files run
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">&#39;rvm rvmrc warning ignore all .rvmrcs&#39;</span>.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~/Code/Ruby/apps/mydirectory<span class="o">[</span>master<span class="o">]</span><span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Decision: Do the Update</h4>

<p>Ignoring a warning feels like sticking my head in the sand. It&#8217;s better to face things head-on. So I decided to go with the update. If things don&#8217;t work out, I can always remove RVM completely and start from scratch.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~/Code/Ruby/apps/mydirectory<span class="o">[</span>master<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm rvmrc to .ruby-version
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>My shell responded by repeating the <code>.rvmrc</code> vs <code>.ruby-version</code> notice. But when I examine the directory, everything looks good.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>total 56
</span><span class='line'>drwx---rwx   53 rth  wheel   1802 Apr 19 07:18 .
</span><span class='line'>drwx---rwx   27 rth  wheel    918 Feb 10 08:26 ..
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--    1 rth  wheel    175 Feb  4 13:41 .gitignore
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--@   1 rth  wheel      0 Oct 15  2012 .repl_history
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--    1 rth  wheel     11 Apr 19 07:18 .ruby-gemset
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--    1 rth  wheel     16 Apr 19 07:18 .ruby-version
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x   10 rth  wheel    340 Feb 14 20:41 AFNetworking-RubyMotion-Example
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x   13 rth  wheel    442 Feb 24 17:29 AccordionUIView
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Instead of a single <code>.rvmrc</code> file, Ruby versions are managed by
<code>.ruby-version</code> while gemsets are managed through <code>.ruby-gemset</code>.</p>

<h4>Bash Alias</h4>

<p>Next, it&#8217;s time to clean things up by adding an <code>alias</code> to
<code>~/.bash_profile</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">newrvm</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;rvm rvmrc to .ruby-version&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Tell the terminal session to use the new <code>~/.bash_profile</code> with</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bash_profile
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And now we can begin using <code>.ruby-version</code> and <code>.ruby-gemset</code> in any .rvmrc-equipped directory with a simple one-word command.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>newrvm
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/moth.png" width="300" height="215" align="right" title="Emperor moth photo by Dean Morley" alt="Emperor moth photo by Dean Morley">
A man found a cocoon of an emperor moth. He took it home so that he could watch the moth come out of the cocoon. On the day a small opening appeared, he sat and watched the moth for several hours as the moth struggled to force its body through that little hole.</p>

<p>Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and it could go no farther. It just seemed to be stuck.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Kindness</h4>

<p>Then the man, in his kindness, decided to help the moth, so he took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The moth then emerged easily. But it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings. The man continued to watch the moth because he expected that, at any moment, the wings would enlarge and expand to be able to support the body, which would contract in time. Neither happened! In fact, the little moth spent the rest of its life crawling around with a swollen body and shriveled body and shriveled wings. It never was able to fly.</p>

<h4>Helping vs. Understanding</h4>

<p>What the man in his kindness and haste did not understand was that the restricting cocoon and the struggle required for the moth to get through the tiny opening was the way of forcing fluid from the body of the moth into its wings so that it would be ready for flight once it achieved its freedom from the cocoon. Freedom and flight would only come after the struggle. By depriving the moth of a struggle, he deprived the moth of health.</p>

<h4>Obstacles and Growth</h4>

<p>Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If we were to go through our life without any obstacles, we would be crippled. We would not be as strong as what we could have been. Give every opportunity a chance, and leave no room for regrets.</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/03/19/how-to-take-a-raspberry-pi-screenshot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After you get a <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a> up and running, you may want to take a few screenshots so you can share the experience with others. Here&#8217;s how.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Install Scrot</h4>

<p>First, install the screenshot utility, <code>scrot</code>. Open up the LXTerminal
and type the following at the prompt:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install scrot
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Use Scrot</h4>

<p>To take a screenshot of the whole screen:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo scrot
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By default, the screenshot will be stored in the current directory in a file named for the numerical date and time with a <code>.png</code> extension.</p>

<p>To take a screenshot after a 10-second delay:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo scrot -d10
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Learn More About Scrot</h4>

<p>To display a list of Scrot commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo scrot -h
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <updated>2013-03-13T15:31:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/03/13/you-can-do-it-now</id>

If you are fortunate enough to work in the technology industry, you do not need permission to move forward. So do it now.</p>

<p>Yes, you will have to define <em>it</em> for yourself.</p>

<h4>ChiPMA – Product Management</h4>

<p>A few years ago I had the pleasure of hearing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igsvMAU5POY">Suneel Gupta</a> speak at a Chicago Product Management Association meeting hosted by Pathfinder Development. Three points raised during Gupta’s talk:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conditions are never perfect. So start now.</li>
<li>What does <em>start</em> mean? Figure that out, and draw out the plan.</li>
<li>If you suck at first, keep going.</li>
<li>Conditions are never perfect.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h4>Learning From History</h4>

<p>Gupta is a student of history. He began the talk by drawing parallels between today’s startup culture and the early days of powered flight.</p>

<p>In the late 1800s, Samuel Pierpont Langley was an accomplished engineer with great connections to money and resources. One of his lifelong goals was to develop a vehicle for powered flight. He built several successful models, hired the smartest collaborators he could find, and he even raised $50k (in 1898 dollars) from investors. Newspaper reporters followed his entourage as they conducted experiments. Surely, this team of thoroughbreds would solve the flight puzzle.</p>

<p>But most people have never heard of Langley. Somewhere in Ohio, far from the news outlets of the day, the Wright Brothers achieved the goal first. When Langley heard the news, he stopped trying.</p>

<p>Why did the Wright Brothers win? They never waited for perfect conditions. The Wright Brothers did what they could with the resources they had at the time. Maybe constraints are advantages in disguise.</p>

<h4>Draw Out the Plan</h4>

<p>Everybody has dreams. Something magical happens when we take the time to map out our dreams on paper.</p>

<p>Gupta’s example: Jack Dorsey, creator of Twitter. Dorsey drew the first mock-up for Twitter on paper. And then he showed it to people. Some laughed. Many gave feedback. He used the feedback to hone the idea into a viable product.</p>

<p>Until you put the idea on paper (or some other medium) so you can show it to potential customers and collaborators, you’ll never get the feedback you need to improve.</p>

<h4>Keep Going</h4>

<p>Gupta and his brother had an idea. They wanted to create videos about the first wave of Indians to move to America. They approached Hollywood experts about creating the videos.</p>

<p>&#8220;You’ll need at least $1 million,&#8221; they were told. Much too expensive. Most people fold when facing a million dollar wall.</p>

<p>But Suneel and his brother made their own videos with the equipment they had available. The videos were not million-dollar productions. But here’s the upside: When they were done, they had something of substance that they could show to people. They posted their work at <a href="http://kahanimovement.com">KahaniMovement.com</a>. One viewer liked the site enough to send a link to Steven Spielberg.</p>

<p>Spielberg viewed the videos and he gave the brothers clear, actionable feedback. They made improvements. And they learned something interesting about Spielberg in the process: Even Spielberg starts with a loose cut sometimes! When Spielberg has a fresh idea that he’s trying to communicate, he will grab a hand-held camera, shoot the idea (no matter how rough) and show it to his team. If a picture is a thousand words, then a video is… you get the idea.</p>

<h4>Teachers &amp; Parents Ignite Our Passion</h4>

<p>Gupta shared a story about his 7th grade social studies class. The class watched a film of JFK delivering his inaugural speech in 1960. Gupta was moved. At the end of the film, the teacher informed that class that JFK had not written the speech. The author was Ted Sorensen, a man whom Kennedy called his <em>intellectual blood bank</em>.</p>

<p>In 7th grade, Gupta had found his calling. He would become a speech writer.</p>

<p>He went home and told his mother about his decision to become a speech writer. And that’s when his mother gave him a powerful piece of advice: &#8220;If you want to do that, you don’t have to wait. You can do it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can do it now. What are you waiting for?</p>

<blockquote><p>You will be baffled from time to time… Stick with this book. I promise the bewilderment will cease before you get to the final page.<br/>~ Aaron Hillegass, Author</p></blockquote>

<h4>Finding the Right Objective-C Book</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve gone through several Objective-C books in my quest to master <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>. You read that right: I&#8217;m learning Objective-C so that I can master RubyMotion. <em>Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em> is one book that clicks for me. Here&#8217;s why.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li><p>Minimal fluff. Other Objective-C books start off with speeches about why a dev should write for iOS. What a waste of paper. The Big Nerd approach: Start with a few paragraphs about C, and then jump right in to Xcode installation followed by &#8220;Hello World.&#8221; Refreshingly direct.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear examples. As I immerse myself deeper into the world of Objective-C, I am troubled by much of the documentation. It&#8217;s okay to describe a method signature, but a description with an example is much better. While reading other Objective-C books, I found myself pausing to search Stack Overflow for alternate explanations. The Big Nerd book is better because everything is self-contained. Method descriptions are followed by clear examples.</p></li>
<li><p>Zero Assumptions. Even though the book contains minimal fluff, readers will appreciate how the author defines terms throughout the text. For example, the book does not assume that the reader knows the classroom definition of the word <em>syntax</em>. It defines the word explicitly:</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Syntax is the set of rules that governs how your code must be written in a given programming language. These rules are extremely specific, and if you fail to follow them, your program won&#8217;t work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Clearly put!</p>

<h4>Do I Really Need Objective-C?</h4>

<p>Yes. If you want to be effective with RubyMotion, you must grow strong with Objective-C.</p>

<p>The RubyMotion devs whom I admire most also know Objective-C. Devs like Matt Aimonetti (creator of BubbleWrap), Randall Thomas and Tammer Saleh (authors of <em>RubyMotion in the Cloud</em>), Jonathan Penn (instructor/speaker at CocoaConf) and Laurent Sansonetti (creator of RubyMotion) move seamlessly between the worlds of Ruby and Objective-C. Luke became a Jedi because he followed in the footsteps of Yoda.</p>

<p>More important than following the masters: Learning from their triumphs and mistakes by reading their code. Developers in 2013 are fortunate to have tools like GitHub where code is shared on a massive scale. Most iOS code is written in Objective-C. If we want to learn from the iOS code that has been written before, we need to know Objective-C.</p>

<h4>Highly Recommended</h4>

<p>If you want to develop apps for iOS devices, start with <em>Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em>. The book is also helpful if you prefer RubyMotion over Objective-C.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/pong-rubymotion-objective-c.png" width="300" height="160" alt="Atari's Pong in RubyMotion and Objective-C" title="Atari's Pong in RubyMotion and Objective-C" align="right">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Atari&#8217;s Pong</a> is a classic video arcade game from the 1970s. Seeing Pong always gives me childhood flashbacks.</p>

<h4>Pong in Objective-C</h4>

<p>I recently completed the <a href="http://mobilemakers.co/ios-accelerated">iOS Accelerated</a> course at the <a href="http://mobilemakers.co/">Mobile Makers Academy</a>. For one of our homework assignments, we were asked to build a version of Pong that runs on iOS. Our instructor, <a href="http://twitter.com/dbora">Don Bora</a>, started us off with some skeleton code in Objective-C. Each student had to take Don&#8217;s code and:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add paddles.</li>
<li>Make the paddles move on their own.</li>
<li>Make the ball bounce off the moving paddles.</li>
<li>Keep score.</li>
<li>Let one or two players control the paddles via touch.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h4>Questions to Consider</h4>

<p>How do you determine whether the pixels of the ball have collided with the pixels of a paddle? What about wall collisions? When a collision occurs, where should the ball bounce next? As with any application, there are many details to consider.</p>

<h4>Building Blocks</h4>

<p>Of course, Don had already introduced the necessary skills in earlier lectures, labs, and homework. It was our job to put the pieces together.</p>

<p>Members of the class paired with each other. We shared solutions and advice. In time, we each ended up with a working version of Pong in Objective-C. It&#8217;s exciting to see a favorite childhood game running in the iOS simulator on your own machine, especially if you built the game yourself.</p>

<h4>Pong in RubyMotion</h4>

<p>Since my day job revolves around Ruby, it made sense to re-write the exercise in <a href="http://rayhightower.dev/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>. Here are video clips of my two solutions. The first was written in Objective-C during the Mobile Makers course. The second was written in RubyMotion.</p>

<center><iframe name="pong-oc" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9LETiMdi9jQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe></center>




<center><iframe name="pong-rm" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lt-JKqiA_fg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<p>As expected, the two solutions look similar. Source code is on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-oc">Pong in Objective-C</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-rm">Pong in RubyMotion</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>RubyMotion Gotchas</h4>

<p>I encountered a few RubyMotion snags during development:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Mouseovers Ingored</em>. Normally, when running the simulator with RubyMotion, you can mouse over an object in the simulator, hit the command key, and grab a handle to the object.  This behavior was absent in landcape mode with version 1.31 of RubyMotion. The release notes for version 1.33 mention that the problem has been solved. However, that was not my experience.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Touch Events Ignored on Part of Screen</em>. For some reason, the simulator ignored touch events on the right side of the screen. When I programatically moved the right paddle closer to the left side of the screen, both paddles responded to touch events. Searches of Google and Stack Overflow reveal that others have encounterd the same issue with touch events, especially in landcape mode.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><em>Update (3/13/2013): The issue with touch events has been resolved, thanks to advice from Turki Al-Qusaimi in the comments below. Updated code has been pushed to the <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/pong-rm">master branch on GitHub</a>.</em></p>

<p>Of course, I introduced a few bugs of my own while developing the Pong game. At one point, the velocity of the ball increased every time a player scored. It made the game exciting! But I didn&#8217;t know the cause of the acceleration, and good developers strive to maintain better control over their projects.</p>

<p>I eventually found the acceleration problem: When using an NSTimer object to control animation, you have to invalidate the timer at the beginning of each cycle, or the animation will accelerate. That&#8217;s a useful thing to know.</p>

<p>The rest of my work in RubyMotion went well, and I continue to enjoy the product. I plan to update the code once the touch event issues have been resolved.</p>

<h4>Why Play Games?</h4>

<p>Why should a serious developer spend time writing games? I can think of a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Writing a game challenges our skills on many levels. In the case of Pong, we have to dust off our old physics and geometry textbooks to ensure that the ball bounces like a real ball.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing a game lets us break out of our constraints. Devs who write business apps are very familiar with constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>Because writing a game is fun.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, the most important reason was given by a captain of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701:</p>

<blockquote><p>The more advanced the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.
<br/>~James T. Kirk</p></blockquote>

<h4>Room for Improvement</h4>

<p>Building the Pong game was an interesting exercise in testing the capabilities of RubyMotion. Having done the work, I can look back and see some areas where I could improve the results. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Automated testing. These proof-of-concept exercises were done without automated testing. What is the best way to apply test driven development to a game? RubyMotion comes with a TDD framework, MacBacon. That would be a great subject for a future blog post.</p></li>
<li><p>Better design. Each exercise looks like something from the 1970s! How would Pong function if it was created in 2013?</p></li>
<li><p>Better collision detection. I&#8217;m using a built-in iOS method to detect ball collisions. The built-in detection works fine with the stationary walls, but not as well with the moving paddles. If I write a future version of Pong, I should also write a custom collision detection method.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Comments and Pull Requests</h4>
